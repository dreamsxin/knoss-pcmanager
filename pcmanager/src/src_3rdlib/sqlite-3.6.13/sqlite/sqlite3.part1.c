/******************************************************************************
** This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from SQLite
** version 3.6.13.  By combining all the individual C code files into this 
** single large file, the entire code can be compiled as a one translation
** unit.  This allows many compilers to do optimizations that would not be
** possible if the files were compiled separately.  Performance improvements
** of 5% are more are commonly seen when SQLite is compiled as a single
** translation unit.
**
** This file is all you need to compile SQLite.  To use SQLite in other
** programs, you need this file and the "sqlite3.h" header file that defines
** the programming interface to the SQLite library.  (If you do not have 
** the "sqlite3.h" header file at hand, you will find a copy in the first
** 5503 lines past this header comment.)  Additional code files may be
** needed if you want a wrapper to interface SQLite with your choice of
** programming language.  The code for the "sqlite3" command-line shell
** is also in a separate file.  This file contains only code for the core
** SQLite library.
**
** This amalgamation was generated on 2009-04-13 09:10:17 UTC.

**
** The sqlite3_exec() interface is a convenient way of running one or more
** SQL statements without having to write a lot of C code.  The UTF-8 encoded
** SQL statements are passed in as the second parameter to sqlite3_exec().
** The statements are evaluated one by one until either an error or
** an interrupt is encountered, or until they are all done.  The 3rd parameter
** is an optional callback that is invoked once for each row of any query
** results produced by the SQL statements.  The 5th parameter tells where
** to write any error messages.
**
** The error message passed back through the 5th parameter is held
** in memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].  To avoid a memory leak,
** the calling application should call [sqlite3_free()] on any error
** message returned through the 5th parameter when it has finished using
** the error message.
**
** If the SQL statement in the 2nd parameter is NULL or an empty string
** or a string containing only whitespace and comments, then no SQL
** statements are evaluated and the database is not changed.
**
** The sqlite3_exec() interface is implemented in terms of
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_step()], and [sqlite3_finalize()].
** The sqlite3_exec() routine does nothing to the database that cannot be done
** by [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_step()], and [sqlite3_finalize()].
**
** The first parameter to [sqlite3_exec()] must be an valid and open
** [database connection].
**
** The database connection must not be closed while
** [sqlite3_exec()] is running.
**
** The calling function should use [sqlite3_free()] to free
** the memory that *errmsg is left pointing at once the error

** [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
** This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
** against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
** [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
** The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
** flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
** and not its inode needs to be synced.
**
** The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of

** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or

** xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
** The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
** either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
** PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
** if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
**
** The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
** VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
** [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
** integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
** point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
** write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
** functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
** locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
** about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
** core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.

** in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".
**
** The value of the iVersion field is initially 1 but may be larger in

** object when the iVersion value is increased.  Note that the structure
** of the sqlite3_vfs object changes in the transaction between
** SQLite version 3.5.9 and 3.6.0 and yet the iVersion field was not
** modified.
**
** The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
** structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
** a pathname in this VFS.
**
** Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
** the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
** and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
** in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
** searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
** implementation should use the pNext pointer.
**
** The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
** structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
** or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
** The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
** object once the object has been registered.
**
** The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
** be unique across all VFS modules.
**
** SQLite will guarantee that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
** is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
** from xFullPathname().  SQLite further guarantees that
** the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
** called. Because of the previous sentense,
** the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
** filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
** If the zFilename parameter is xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
** must invite its own temporary name for the file.  Whenever the 
** xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
** flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
**
** The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
** the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]. 
** If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
** include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
**
** SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
** call, depending on the object being opened:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]

** The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
** change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
** that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
** the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
** also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
** SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
** file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
** order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
**
** SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
** </ul>
**
** The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
** deleted when it is closed.  The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** will be set for TEMP  databases, journals and for subjournals.
**
** The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag means the file should be opened
** for exclusive access.  This flag is set for all files except
** for the main database file.
**
** At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
** to hold the  [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
** argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
** allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.
**
** The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
** to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
** test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
** to test whether a file is at least readable.   The file can be a
** directory.
**
** SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
** output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
** is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
** is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
** handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
** to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
**
** The xRandomness(), xSleep(), and xCurrentTime() interfaces
** are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
** included in the VFS structure for completeness.
** The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
** of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
** the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
** The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
** least the number of microseconds given.  The xCurrentTime()
** method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time.

** CAPI3REF: Initialize The SQLite Library {H10130} <S20000><S30100>
**
** The sqlite3_initialize() routine initializes the
** SQLite library.  The sqlite3_shutdown() routine
** deallocates any resources that were allocated by sqlite3_initialize().
**
** A call to sqlite3_initialize() is an "effective" call if it is
** the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked during the lifetime of
** the process, or if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked
** following a call to sqlite3_shutdown().  Only an effective call
** of sqlite3_initialize() does any initialization.  All other calls
** are harmless no-ops.
**
** Among other things, sqlite3_initialize() shall invoke
** sqlite3_os_init().  Similarly, sqlite3_shutdown()
** shall invoke sqlite3_os_end().
**
** The sqlite3_initialize() routine returns [SQLITE_OK] on success.
** If for some reason, sqlite3_initialize() is unable to initialize
** the library (perhaps it is unable to allocate a needed resource such
** as a mutex) it returns an [error code] other than [SQLITE_OK].
**
** The sqlite3_initialize() routine is called internally by many other
** SQLite interfaces so that an application usually does not need to
** invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly.  For example, [sqlite3_open()]
** calls sqlite3_initialize() so the SQLite library will be automatically
** initialized when [sqlite3_open()] is called if it has not be initialized
** already.  However, if SQLite is compiled with the [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT]
** compile-time option, then the automatic calls to sqlite3_initialize()
** are omitted and the application must call sqlite3_initialize() directly
** prior to using any other SQLite interface.  For maximum portability,
** it is recommended that applications always invoke sqlite3_initialize()
** directly prior to using any other SQLite interface.  Future releases
** of SQLite may require this.  In other words, the behavior exhibited
** when SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT] might become the
** default behavior in some future release of SQLite.
**
** The sqlite3_os_init() routine does operating-system specific
** initialization of the SQLite library.  The sqlite3_os_end()
** routine undoes the effect of sqlite3_os_init().  Typical tasks
** performed by these routines include allocation or deallocation
** of static resources, initialization of global variables,
** setting up a default [sqlite3_vfs] module, or setting up
** a default configuration using [sqlite3_config()].
**
** The application should never invoke either sqlite3_os_init()
** or sqlite3_os_end() directly.  The application should only invoke
** sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown().  The sqlite3_os_init()
** interface is called automatically by sqlite3_initialize() and
** sqlite3_os_end() is called by sqlite3_shutdown().  Appropriate
** implementations for sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end()
** are built into SQLite when it is compiled for unix, windows, or os/2.
** When built for other platforms (using the [SQLITE_OS_OTHER=1] compile-time
** option) the application must supply a suitable implementation for
** sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end().  An application-supplied
** implementation of sqlite3_os_init() or sqlite3_os_end()
** must return [SQLITE_OK] on success and some other [error code] upon

** and that this object is only useful to a tiny minority of applications
** with specialized memory allocation requirements.  This object is
** also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative

** order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such
** conditions.
**
** The xMalloc, xFree, and xRealloc methods must work like the
** malloc(), free(), and realloc() functions from the standard library.

** to find the total number of changes including changes caused by triggers.
**
** A "row change" is a change to a single row of a single table
** caused by an INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement.  Rows that
** are changed as side effects of REPLACE constraint resolution,
** rollback, ABORT processing, DROP TABLE, or by any other
** mechanisms do not count as direct row changes.
**
** A "trigger context" is a scope of execution that begins and
** ends with the script of a trigger.  Most SQL statements are
** evaluated outside of any trigger.  This is the "top level"
** trigger context.  If a trigger fires from the top level, a
** new trigger context is entered for the duration of that one
** trigger.  Subtriggers create subcontexts for their duration.
**
** Calling [sqlite3_exec()] or [sqlite3_step()] recursively does
** not create a new trigger context.
**
** This function returns the number of direct row changes in the
** most recent INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement within the same
** trigger context.
**
** Thus, when called from the top level, this function returns the
** number of changes in the most recent INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
** that also occurred at the top level.  Within the body of a trigger,
** the sqlite3_changes() interface can be called to find the number of
** changes in the most recently completed INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
** statement within the body of the same trigger.
** However, the number returned does not include changes
** caused by subtriggers since those have their own context.
**
** SQLite implements the command "DELETE FROM table" without a WHERE clause
** by dropping and recreating the table.  Doing so is much faster than going
** through and deleting individual elements from the table.  Because of this
** optimization, the deletions in "DELETE FROM table" are not row changes and
** will not be counted by the sqlite3_changes() or [sqlite3_total_changes()]

** or process has locked.
**
** If the busy callback is NULL, then [SQLITE_BUSY] or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED]
** is returned immediately upon encountering the lock. If the busy callback
** is not NULL, then the callback will be invoked with two arguments.
**
** The first argument to the handler is a copy of the void* pointer which
** is the third argument to sqlite3_busy_handler().  The second argument to
** the handler callback is the number of times that the busy handler has
** been invoked for this locking event.  If the
** busy callback returns 0, then no additional attempts are made to
** access the database and [SQLITE_BUSY] or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] is returned.
** If the callback returns non-zero, then another attempt
** is made to open the database for reading and the cycle repeats.
**
** The presence of a busy handler does not guarantee that it will be invoked
** when there is lock contention. If SQLite determines that invoking the busy
** handler could result in a deadlock, it will go ahead and return [SQLITE_BUSY]
** or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] instead of invoking the busy handler.
** Consider a scenario where one process is holding a read lock that
** it is trying to promote to a reserved lock and
** a second process is holding a reserved lock that it is trying
** to promote to an exclusive lock.  The first process cannot proceed
** because it is blocked by the second and the second process cannot
** proceed because it is blocked by the first.  If both processes
** invoke the busy handlers, neither will make any progress.  Therefore,
** SQLite returns [SQLITE_BUSY] for the first process, hoping that this
** will induce the first process to release its read lock and allow
** the second process to proceed.
**
** The default busy callback is NULL.
**
** The [SQLITE_BUSY] error is converted to [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED]
** when SQLite is in the middle of a large transaction where all the
** changes will not fit into the in-memory cache.  SQLite will
** already hold a RESERVED lock on the database file, but it needs
** to promote this lock to EXCLUSIVE so that it can spill cache
** pages into the database file without harm to concurrent
** readers.  If it is unable to promote the lock, then the in-memory
** cache will be left in an inconsistent state and so the error
** code is promoted from the relatively benign [SQLITE_BUSY] to
** the more severe [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED].  This error code promotion
** forces an automatic rollback of the changes.  See the
** <a href="/cvstrac/wiki?p=CorruptionFollowingBusyError">

** CAPI3REF: Convenience Routines For Running Queries {H12370} <S10000>
**
** Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
** [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
** complete query results from one or more queries.
**
** The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
** these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
** numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
** and M be the number of columns.
**
** A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
** There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  The first M pointers point
** to zero-terminated strings that  contain the names of the columns.
** The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL values result
** in NULL pointers.  All other values are in their UTF-8 zero-terminated
** string representation as returned by [sqlite3_column_text()].
**
** A result table might consist of one or more memory allocations.
** It is not safe to pass a result table directly to [sqlite3_free()].
** A result table should be deallocated using [sqlite3_free_table()].
**
** As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result
** is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** There are two column (M==2) and three rows (N==3).  Thus the
** result table has 8 entries.  Suppose the result table is stored
** in an array names azResult.  Then azResult holds this content:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        azResult&#91;0] = "Name";
**        azResult&#91;1] = "Age";
**        azResult&#91;2] = "Alice";
**        azResult&#91;3] = "43";
**        azResult&#91;4] = "Bob";
**        azResult&#91;5] = "28";
**        azResult&#91;6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult&#91;7] = "21";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more
** semicolon-separated SQL statements in the zero-terminated UTF-8
** string of its 2nd parameter.  It returns a result table to the
** pointer given in its 3rd parameter.
**
** After the calling function has finished using the result, it should
** pass the pointer to the result table to sqlite3_free_table() in order to
** release the memory that was malloced.  Because of the way the
** [sqlite3_malloc()] happens within sqlite3_get_table(), the calling
** function must not try to call [sqlite3_free()] directly.  Only
** [sqlite3_free_table()] is able to release the memory properly and safely.
**
** The sqlite3_get_table() interface is implemented as a wrapper around
** [sqlite3_exec()].  The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access
** to any internal data structures of SQLite.  It uses only the public
** interface defined here.  As a consequence, errors that occur in the
** wrapper layer outside of the internal [sqlite3_exec()] call are not
** reflected in subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] or [sqlite3_errmsg()].

** CAPI3REF: Formatted String Printing Functions {H17400} <S70000><S20000>
**
** These routines are workalikes of the "printf()" family of functions
** from the standard C library.
**
** The sqlite3_mprintf() and sqlite3_vmprintf() routines write their
** results into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].
** The strings returned by these two routines should be
** released by [sqlite3_free()].  Both routines return a
** NULL pointer if [sqlite3_malloc()] is unable to allocate enough
** memory to hold the resulting string.
**
** In sqlite3_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
** the standard C library.  The result is written into the
** buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
** the first parameter. Note that the order of the
** first two parameters is reversed from snprintf().  This is an
** historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
** backwards compatibility.  Note also that sqlite3_snprintf()
** returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
** characters actually written into the buffer.  We admit that
** the number of characters written would be a more useful return
** value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf()
** now without breaking compatibility.
**
** As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite3_snprintf()
** guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  The first
** parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
** the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
** written will be n-1 characters.
**
** These routines all implement some additional formatting
** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
** All of the usual printf() formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is are "%q", "%Q", and "%z" options.
**
** The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a null-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, assume the string variable zText contains text as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you should
** always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string literal.
**
** The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
** the outside of the total string.  Additionally, if the parameter in the
** argument list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without
** single quotes) in place of the %Q option.  So, for example, one could say:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
** variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.
**
** The "%z" formatting option works exactly like "%s" with the
** addition that after the string has been read and copied into
** the result, [sqlite3_free()] is called on the input string. {END}

** CAPI3REF: Memory Allocation Subsystem {H17300} <S20000>
**
** The SQLite core  uses these three routines for all of its own
** internal memory allocation needs. "Core" in the previous sentence
** does not include operating-system specific VFS implementation.  The
** Windows VFS uses native malloc() and free() for some operations.
**
** The sqlite3_malloc() routine returns a pointer to a block
** of memory at least N bytes in length, where N is the parameter.
** If sqlite3_malloc() is unable to obtain sufficient free
** memory, it returns a NULL pointer.  If the parameter N to
** sqlite3_malloc() is zero or negative then sqlite3_malloc() returns
** a NULL pointer.
**
** Calling sqlite3_free() with a pointer previously returned
** by sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc() releases that memory so
** that it might be reused.  The sqlite3_free() routine is
** a no-op if is called with a NULL pointer.  Passing a NULL pointer
** to sqlite3_free() is harmless.  After being freed, memory
** should neither be read nor written.  Even reading previously freed
** memory might result in a segmentation fault or other severe error.
** Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error
** might result if sqlite3_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that
** was not obtained from sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc().
**
** The sqlite3_realloc() interface attempts to resize a
** prior memory allocation to be at least N bytes, where N is the
** second parameter.  The memory allocation to be resized is the first
** parameter.  If the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc()
** is a NULL pointer then its behavior is identical to calling
** sqlite3_malloc(N) where N is the second parameter to sqlite3_realloc().
** If the second parameter to sqlite3_realloc() is zero or
** negative then the behavior is exactly the same as calling
** sqlite3_free(P) where P is the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc().
** sqlite3_realloc() returns a pointer to a memory allocation
** of at least N bytes in size or NULL if sufficient memory is unavailable.
** If M is the size of the prior allocation, then min(N,M) bytes
** of the prior allocation are copied into the beginning of buffer returned
** by sqlite3_realloc() and the prior allocation is freed.
** If sqlite3_realloc() returns NULL, then the prior allocation
** is not freed.
**
** The memory returned by sqlite3_malloc() and sqlite3_realloc()
** is always aligned to at least an 8 byte boundary. {END}
**

**
** The first parameter to the authorizer callback is a copy of the third
** parameter to the sqlite3_set_authorizer() interface. The second parameter
** to the callback is an integer [SQLITE_COPY | action code] that specifies
** the particular action to be authorized. The third through sixth parameters
** to the callback are zero-terminated strings that contain additional
** details about the action to be authorized.
**
** An authorizer is used when [sqlite3_prepare | preparing]
** SQL statements from an untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements
** do not try to access data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not
** try to execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
** example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
** SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being [sqlite3_prepare | prepared] that
** disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
**
** Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
** might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite3_limit()]
** and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
** in addition to using an authorizer.
**
** Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite3_set_authorizer overrides the
** previous call.  Disable the authorizer by installing a NULL callback.
** The authorizer is disabled by default.
**
** The authorizer callback must not do anything that will modify
** the database connection that invoked the authorizer callback.
** Note that [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_step()] both modify their
** database connections for the meaning of "modify" in this paragraph.
**
** When [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] is used to prepare a statement, the
** statement might be reprepared during [sqlite3_step()] due to a 
** schema change.  Hence, the application should ensure that the
** correct authorizer callback remains in place during the [sqlite3_step()].
**
** Note that the authorizer callback is invoked only during
** [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants.  Authorization is not
** performed during statement evaluation in [sqlite3_step()].

** CAPI3REF: Opening A New Database Connection {H12700} <S40200>
**
** These routines open an SQLite database file whose name is given by the
** filename argument. The filename argument is interpreted as UTF-8 for
** sqlite3_open() and sqlite3_open_v2() and as UTF-16 in the native byte
** order for sqlite3_open16(). A [database connection] handle is usually
** returned in *ppDb, even if an error occurs.  The only exception is that
** if SQLite is unable to allocate memory to hold the [sqlite3] object,
** a NULL will be written into *ppDb instead of a pointer to the [sqlite3]
** object. If the database is opened (and/or created) successfully, then
** [SQLITE_OK] is returned.  Otherwise an [error code] is returned.  The
** [sqlite3_errmsg()] or [sqlite3_errmsg16()] routines can be used to obtain
** an English language description of the error.
**
** The default encoding for the database will be UTF-8 if
** sqlite3_open() or sqlite3_open_v2() is called and
** UTF-16 in the native byte order if sqlite3_open16() is used.
**
** Whether or not an error occurs when it is opened, resources
** associated with the [database connection] handle should be released by
** passing it to [sqlite3_close()] when it is no longer required.
**
** The sqlite3_open_v2() interface works like sqlite3_open()
** except that it accepts two additional parameters for additional control
** over the new database connection.  The flags parameter can take one of
** the following three values, optionally combined with the 
** [SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX] or [SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX] flags:
**
** <dl>
** <dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened in read-only mode.  If the database does not
** already exist, an error is returned.</dd>
**
** <dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened for reading and writing if possible, or reading
** only if the file is write protected by the operating system.  In either
** case the database must already exist, otherwise an error is returned.</dd>
**
** <dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened for reading and writing, and is creates it if
** it does not already exist. This is the behavior that is always used for
** sqlite3_open() and sqlite3_open16().</dd>
** </dl>
**
** If the 3rd parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is not one of the
** combinations shown above or one of the combinations shown above combined
** with the [SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX] or [SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX] flags,
** then the behavior is undefined.
**
** If the [SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX] flag is set, then the database connection
** opens in the multi-thread [threading mode] as long as the single-thread
** mode has not been set at compile-time or start-time.  If the
** [SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX] flag is set then the database connection opens
** in the serialized [threading mode] unless single-thread was
** previously selected at compile-time or start-time.
**
** If the filename is ":memory:", then a private, temporary in-memory database
** is created for the connection.  This in-memory database will vanish when
** the database connection is closed.  Future versions of SQLite might
** make use of additional special filenames that begin with the ":" character.
** It is recommended that when a database filename actually does begin with
** a ":" character you should prefix the filename with a pathname such as
** "./" to avoid ambiguity.
**
** If the filename is an empty string, then a private, temporary
** on-disk database will be created.  This private database will be
** automatically deleted as soon as the database connection is closed.
**
** The fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is the name of the
** [sqlite3_vfs] object that defines the operating system interface that
** the new database connection should use.  If the fourth parameter is
** a NULL pointer then the default [sqlite3_vfs] object is used.
**
** <b>Note to Windows users:</b>  The encoding used for the filename argument
** of sqlite3_open() and sqlite3_open_v2() must be UTF-8, not whatever
** codepage is currently defined.  Filenames containing international
** characters must be converted to UTF-8 prior to passing them into

** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement {H13010} <S10000>
** KEYWORDS: {SQL statement compiler}
**
** To execute an SQL query, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines.
**
** The first argument, "db", is a [database connection] obtained from a
** prior successful call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()] or
** [sqlite3_open16()].  The database connection must not have been closed.
**
** The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2()
** interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2()
** use UTF-16.
**
** If the nByte argument is less than zero, then zSql is read up to the
** first zero terminator. If nByte is non-negative, then it is the maximum
** number of  bytes read from zSql.  When nByte is non-negative, the
** zSql string ends at either the first '\000' or '\u0000' character or
** the nByte-th byte, whichever comes first. If the caller knows
** that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then there is a small
** performance advantage to be gained by passing an nByte parameter that
** is equal to the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
** the nul-terminator bytes.
**
** If pzTail is not NULL then *pzTail is made to point to the first byte
** past the end of the first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only
** compile the first statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to
** what remains uncompiled.
**
** *ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  If there is an error, *ppStmt is set
** to NULL.  If the input text contains no SQL (if the input is an empty
** string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
** The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled
** SQL statement using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
** ppStmt may not be NULL.
**
** On success, [SQLITE_OK] is returned, otherwise an [error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() interfaces are
** recommended for all new programs. The two older interfaces are retained

** In the "v2" interfaces, the prepared statement

**
** <ol>
** <li>
** If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
** always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
** statement and try to run it again.  If the schema has changed in
** a way that makes the statement no longer valid, [sqlite3_step()] will still
** return [SQLITE_SCHEMA].  But unlike the legacy behavior, [SQLITE_SCHEMA] is
** now a fatal error.  Calling [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] again will not make the
** error go away.  Note: use [sqlite3_errmsg()] to find the text
** of the parsing error that results in an [SQLITE_SCHEMA] return.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** When an error occurs, [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed
** [error codes] or [extended error codes].  The legacy behavior was that
** [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic [SQLITE_ERROR] result code
** and you would have to make a second call to [sqlite3_reset()] in order
** to find the underlying cause of the problem. With the "v2" prepare
** interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is returned immediately.

**
** SQLite uses the sqlite3_value object to represent all values
** that can be stored in a database table. SQLite uses dynamic typing
** for the values it stores. Values stored in sqlite3_value objects
** can be integers, floating point values, strings, BLOBs, or NULL.
**
** An sqlite3_value object may be either "protected" or "unprotected".
** Some interfaces require a protected sqlite3_value.  Other interfaces
** will accept either a protected or an unprotected sqlite3_value.
** Every interface that accepts sqlite3_value arguments specifies
** whether or not it requires a protected sqlite3_value.
**
** The terms "protected" and "unprotected" refer to whether or not
** a mutex is held.  A internal mutex is held for a protected
** sqlite3_value object but no mutex is held for an unprotected
** sqlite3_value object.  If SQLite is compiled to be single-threaded
** (with [SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0] and with [sqlite3_threadsafe()] returning 0)
** or if SQLite is run in one of reduced mutex modes 
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_SINGLETHREAD] or [SQLITE_CONFIG_MULTITHREAD]
** then there is no distinction between protected and unprotected
** sqlite3_value objects and they can be used interchangeably.  However,
** for maximum code portability it is recommended that applications
** still make the distinction between between protected and unprotected
** sqlite3_value objects even when not strictly required.
**
** The sqlite3_value objects that are passed as parameters into the
** implementation of [application-defined SQL functions] are protected.
** The sqlite3_value object returned by
** [sqlite3_column_value()] is unprotected.
** Unprotected sqlite3_value objects may only be used with
** [sqlite3_result_value()] and [sqlite3_bind_value()].

** KEYWORDS: {SQL parameter} {SQL parameters} {parameter binding}
**
** In the SQL strings input to [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and its variants,
** literals may be replaced by a [parameter] in one of these forms:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  ?
** <li>  ?NNN
** <li>  :VVV
** <li>  @VVV
** <li>  $VVV
** </ul>
**
** In the parameter forms shown above NNN is an integer literal,
** and VVV is an alpha-numeric parameter name. The values of these
** parameters (also called "host parameter names" or "SQL parameters")
** can be set using the sqlite3_bind_*() routines defined here.
**
** The first argument to the sqlite3_bind_*() routines is always
** a pointer to the [sqlite3_stmt] object returned from
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or its variants.
**
** The second argument is the index of the SQL parameter to be set.
** The leftmost SQL parameter has an index of 1.  When the same named
** SQL parameter is used more than once, second and subsequent
** occurrences have the same index as the first occurrence.
** The index for named parameters can be looked up using the
** [sqlite3_bind_parameter_index()] API if desired.  The index
** for "?NNN" parameters is the value of NNN.
** The NNN value must be between 1 and the [sqlite3_limit()]
** parameter [SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER] (default value: 999).
**
** The third argument is the value to bind to the parameter.
**
** In those routines that have a fourth argument, its value is the
** number of bytes in the parameter.  To be clear: the value is the
** number of <u>bytes</u> in the value, not the number of characters.
** If the fourth parameter is negative, the length of the string is
** the number of bytes up to the first zero terminator.
**
** The fifth argument to sqlite3_bind_blob(), sqlite3_bind_text(), and
** sqlite3_bind_text16() is a destructor used to dispose of the BLOB or
** string after SQLite has finished with it. If the fifth argument is
** the special value [SQLITE_STATIC], then SQLite assumes that the
** information is in static, unmanaged space and does not need to be freed.
** If the fifth argument has the value [SQLITE_TRANSIENT], then
** SQLite makes its own private copy of the data immediately, before
** the sqlite3_bind_*() routine returns.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_zeroblob() routine binds a BLOB of length N that
** is filled with zeroes.  A zeroblob uses a fixed amount of memory
** (just an integer to hold its size) while it is being processed.
** Zeroblobs are intended to serve as placeholders for BLOBs whose
** content is later written using
** [sqlite3_blob_open | incremental BLOB I/O] routines.
** A negative value for the zeroblob results in a zero-length BLOB.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_*() routines must be called after
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] (and its variants) or [sqlite3_reset()] and
** before [sqlite3_step()].
** Bindings are not cleared by the [sqlite3_reset()] routine.
** Unbound parameters are interpreted as NULL.
**
** These routines return [SQLITE_OK] on success or an error code if
** anything goes wrong.  [SQLITE_RANGE] is returned if the parameter
** index is out of range.  [SQLITE_NOMEM] is returned if malloc() fails.
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] might be returned if these routines are called on a
** virtual machine that is the wrong state or which has already been finalized.
** Detection of misuse is unreliable.  Applications should not depend
** on SQLITE_MISUSE returns.  SQLITE_MISUSE is intended to indicate a
** a logic error in the application.  Future versions of SQLite might
** panic rather than return SQLITE_MISUSE.

** With the "v2" interface, any of the other [result codes] or
** [extended result codes] might be returned as well.
**
** [SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
** database locks it needs to do its job.  If the statement is a [COMMIT]
** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a [COMMIT] and occurs within a
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** [SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then [SQLITE_ROW]
** is returned each time a new row of data is ready for processing by the
** caller. The values may be accessed using the [column access functions].
** sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
**
** [SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
** With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (for example,
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
** [prepared statement].  In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b> In the legacy interface, the sqlite3_step()

** error other than [SQLITE_BUSY] and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call
** [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the
** specific [error codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed

** to the [prepared statement] that is being evaluated (the [sqlite3_stmt*]
** that was returned from [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or one of its variants)
** and the second argument is the index of the column for which information
** should be returned.  The leftmost column of the result set has the index 0.
**
** If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the
** column index is out of range, the result is undefined.
** These routines may only be called when the most recent call to
** [sqlite3_step()] has returned [SQLITE_ROW] and neither
** [sqlite3_reset()] nor [sqlite3_finalize()] have been called subsequently.
** If any of these routines are called after [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] or after [sqlite3_step()] has returned
** something other than [SQLITE_ROW], the results are undefined.
** If [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()]
** are called from a different thread while any of these routines
** are pending, then the results are undefined.
**
** The sqlite3_column_type() routine returns the
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial data type
** of the result column.  The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
** [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].  The value
** returned by sqlite3_column_type() is only meaningful if no type
** conversions have occurred as described below.  After a type conversion,
** the value returned by sqlite3_column_type() is undefined.  Future
** versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite3_column_type()
** following a type conversion.
**
** If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes()
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** If the result is a UTF-16 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes() converts
** the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes.
** If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** The value returned does not include the zero terminator at the end
** of the string.  For clarity: the value returned is the number of
** bytes in the string, not the number of characters.
**
** Strings returned by sqlite3_column_text() and sqlite3_column_text16(),
** even empty strings, are always zero terminated.  The return
** value from sqlite3_column_blob() for a zero-length BLOB is an arbitrary
** pointer, possibly even a NULL pointer.
**
** The sqlite3_column_bytes16() routine is similar to sqlite3_column_bytes()
** but leaves the result in UTF-16 in native byte order instead of UTF-8.
** The zero terminator is not included in this count.
**
** The object returned by [sqlite3_column_value()] is an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object.  An unprotected sqlite3_value object
** may only be used with [sqlite3_bind_value()] and [sqlite3_result_value()].
** If the [unprotected sqlite3_value] object returned by
** [sqlite3_column_value()] is used in any other way, including calls
** to routines like [sqlite3_value_int()], [sqlite3_value_text()],
** or [sqlite3_value_bytes()], then the behavior is undefined.
**
** These routines attempt to convert the value where appropriate.  For
** example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result
** is requested, [sqlite3_snprintf()] is used internally to perform the
** conversion automatically.  The following table details the conversions
** that are applied:
**
** <blockquote>
** <table border="1">
** <tr><th> Internal<br>Type <th> Requested<br>Type <th>  Conversion
**
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td> INTEGER   <td> Result is 0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Result is 0.0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   TEXT    <td> Result is NULL pointer
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   BLOB    <td> Result is NULL pointer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert from integer to float
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the integer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as INTEGER->TEXT
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td> INTEGER   <td> Convert from float to integer
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the float
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as FLOAT->TEXT
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td> INTEGER   <td> Use atoi()
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Use atof()
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>   BLOB    <td> No change
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td> INTEGER   <td> Convert to TEXT then use atoi()
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert to TEXT then use atof()
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>   TEXT    <td> Add a zero terminator if needed
** </table>
** </blockquote>
**
** The table above makes reference to standard C library functions atoi()
** and atof().  SQLite does not really use these functions.  It has its
** own equivalent internal routines.  The atoi() and atof() names are
** used in the table for brevity and because they are familiar to most
** C programmers.
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or
** sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated.
** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li> The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**      need to be added to the string.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-16.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
**      sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-8.</li>
** </ul>
**
** Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer points to will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they
** are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
**
** The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
** <ul>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text16() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes16()</li>
** </ul>
**
** In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(),
** sqlite3_column_blob(), or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result
** into the desired format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or
** sqlite3_column_bytes16() to find the size of the result.  Do not mix calls
** to sqlite3_column_text() or sqlite3_column_blob() with calls to
** sqlite3_column_bytes16(), and do not mix calls to sqlite3_column_text16()
** with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes().
**
** The pointers returned are valid until a type conversion occurs as
** described above, or until [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] is called.  The memory space used to hold strings
** and BLOBs is freed automatically.  Do <b>not</b> pass the pointers returned
** [sqlite3_column_blob()], [sqlite3_column_text()], etc. into
** [sqlite3_free()].
**
** If a memory allocation error occurs during the evaluation of any
** of these routines, a default value is returned.  The default value
** is either the integer 0, the floating point number 0.0, or a NULL
** pointer.  Subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] will return
** [SQLITE_NOMEM].

** CAPI3REF: Create Or Redefine SQL Functions {H16100} <S20200>
** KEYWORDS: {function creation routines}
** KEYWORDS: {application-defined SQL function}
** KEYWORDS: {application-defined SQL functions}
**
** These two functions (collectively known as "function creation routines")
** are used to add SQL functions or aggregates or to redefine the behavior
** of existing SQL functions or aggregates.  The only difference between the
** two is that the second parameter, the name of the (scalar) function or
** aggregate, is encoded in UTF-8 for sqlite3_create_function() and UTF-16
** for sqlite3_create_function16().
**
** The first parameter is the [database connection] to which the SQL
** function is to be added.  If a single program uses more than one database
** connection internally, then SQL functions must be added individually to
** each database connection.
**
** The second parameter is the name of the SQL function to be created or
** redefined.  The length of the name is limited to 255 bytes, exclusive of
** the zero-terminator.  Note that the name length limit is in bytes, not
** characters.  Any attempt to create a function with a longer name
** will result in [SQLITE_ERROR] being returned.
**
** The third parameter (nArg)
** is the number of arguments that the SQL function or
** aggregate takes. If this parameter is negative, then the SQL function or
** aggregate may take any number of arguments.
**
** The fourth parameter, eTextRep, specifies what
** [SQLITE_UTF8 | text encoding] this SQL function prefers for
** its parameters.  Any SQL function implementation should be able to work
** work with UTF-8, UTF-16le, or UTF-16be.  But some implementations may be
** more efficient with one encoding than another.  It is allowed to
** invoke sqlite3_create_function() or sqlite3_create_function16() multiple
** times with the same function but with different values of eTextRep.
** When multiple implementations of the same function are available, SQLite
** will pick the one that involves the least amount of data conversion.
** If there is only a single implementation which does not care what text
** encoding is used, then the fourth argument should be [SQLITE_ANY].
**
** The fifth parameter is an arbitrary pointer.  The implementation of the
** function can gain access to this pointer using [sqlite3_user_data()].
**
** The seventh, eighth and ninth parameters, xFunc, xStep and xFinal, are
** pointers to C-language functions that implement the SQL function or
** aggregate. A scalar SQL function requires an implementation of the xFunc
** callback only, NULL pointers should be passed as the xStep and xFinal
** parameters. An aggregate SQL function requires an implementation of xStep
** and xFinal and NULL should be passed for xFunc. To delete an existing
** SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL for all three function callbacks.
**
** It is permitted to register multiple implementations of the same
** functions with the same name but with either differing numbers of
** arguments or differing preferred text encodings.  SQLite will use
** the implementation most closely matches the way in which the
** SQL function is used.  A function implementation with a non-negative
** nArg parameter is a better match than a function implementation with
** a negative nArg.  A function where the preferred text encoding
** matches the database encoding is a better
** match than a function where the encoding is different.  
** A function where the encoding difference is between UTF16le and UTF16be
** is a closer match than a function where the encoding difference is
** between UTF8 and UTF16.
**
** Built-in functions may be overloaded by new application-defined functions.
** The first application-defined function with a given name overrides all
** built-in functions in the same [database connection] with the same name.
** Subsequent application-defined functions of the same name only override 
** prior application-defined functions that are an exact match for the
** number of parameters and preferred encoding.
**
** An application-defined function is permitted to call other
** SQLite interfaces.  However, such calls must not
** close the database connection nor finalize or reset the prepared
** statement in which the function is running.

**
** The C-language implementation of SQL functions and aggregates uses
** this set of interface routines to access the parameter values on
** the function or aggregate.
**
** The xFunc (for scalar functions) or xStep (for aggregates) parameters
** to [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** define callbacks that implement the SQL functions and aggregates.
** The 4th parameter to these callbacks is an array of pointers to
** [protected sqlite3_value] objects.  There is one [sqlite3_value] object for
** each parameter to the SQL function.  These routines are used to
** extract values from the [sqlite3_value] objects.
**
** These routines work only with [protected sqlite3_value] objects.
** Any attempt to use these routines on an [unprotected sqlite3_value]
** object results in undefined behavior.
**
** These routines work just like the corresponding [column access functions]
** except that  these routines take a single [protected sqlite3_value] object
** pointer instead of a [sqlite3_stmt*] pointer and an integer column number.
**
** The sqlite3_value_text16() interface extracts a UTF-16 string
** in the native byte-order of the host machine.  The
** sqlite3_value_text16be() and sqlite3_value_text16le() interfaces
** extract UTF-16 strings as big-endian and little-endian respectively.
**
** The sqlite3_value_numeric_type() interface attempts to apply
** numeric affinity to the value.  This means that an attempt is
** made to convert the value to an integer or floating point.  If
** such a conversion is possible without loss of information (in other
** words, if the value is a string that looks like a number)
** then the conversion is performed.  Otherwise no conversion occurs.
** The [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype] after conversion is returned.
**
** Please pay particular attention to the fact that the pointer returned
** from [sqlite3_value_blob()], [sqlite3_value_text()], or

** CAPI3REF: Setting The Result Of An SQL Function {H16400} <S20200>
**
** These routines are used by the xFunc or xFinal callbacks that
** implement SQL functions and aggregates.  See
** [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** for additional information.
**
** These functions work very much like the [parameter binding] family of
** functions used to bind values to host parameters in prepared statements.
** Refer to the [SQL parameter] documentation for additional information.
**
** The sqlite3_result_blob() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be the BLOB whose content is pointed
** to by the second parameter and which is N bytes long where N is the
** third parameter.
**
** The sqlite3_result_zeroblob() interfaces set the result of
** the application-defined function to be a BLOB containing all zero
** bytes and N bytes in size, where N is the value of the 2nd parameter.
**
** The sqlite3_result_double() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be a floating point value specified
** by its 2nd argument.
**
** The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16() functions
** cause the implemented SQL function to throw an exception.
** SQLite uses the string pointed to by the
** 2nd parameter of sqlite3_result_error() or sqlite3_result_error16()
** as the text of an error message.  SQLite interprets the error
** message string from sqlite3_result_error() as UTF-8. SQLite
** interprets the string from sqlite3_result_error16() as UTF-16 in native
** byte order.  If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() is negative then SQLite takes as the error
** message all text up through the first zero character.
** If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error() or
** sqlite3_result_error16() is non-negative then SQLite takes that many
** bytes (not characters) from the 2nd parameter as the error message.
** The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16()
** routines make a private copy of the error message text before
** they return.  Hence, the calling function can deallocate or
** modify the text after they return without harm.
** The sqlite3_result_error_code() function changes the error code
** returned by SQLite as a result of an error in a function.  By default,
** the error code is SQLITE_ERROR.  A subsequent call to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() resets the error code to SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** The sqlite3_result_toobig() interface causes SQLite to throw an error
** indicating that a string or BLOB is to long to represent.
**
** The sqlite3_result_nomem() interface causes SQLite to throw an error
** indicating that a memory allocation failed.
**
** The sqlite3_result_int() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 32-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
** The sqlite3_result_int64() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 64-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
**
** The sqlite3_result_null() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be NULL.
**
** The sqlite3_result_text(), sqlite3_result_text16(),
** sqlite3_result_text16le(), and sqlite3_result_text16be() interfaces
** set the return value of the application-defined function to be
** a text string which is represented as UTF-8, UTF-16 native byte order,
** UTF-16 little endian, or UTF-16 big endian, respectively.
** SQLite takes the text result from the application from
** the 2nd parameter of the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces.
** If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is negative, then SQLite takes result text from the 2nd parameter
** through the first zero character.
** If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is non-negative, then as many bytes (not characters) of the text
** pointed to by the 2nd parameter are taken as the application-defined
** function result.
** If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is a non-NULL pointer, then SQLite calls that
** function as the destructor on the text or BLOB result when it has
** finished using that result.
** If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces or
** sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_STATIC, then SQLite
** assumes that the text or BLOB result is in constant space and does not
** copy the it or call a destructor when it has finished using that result.
** If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_TRANSIENT
** then SQLite makes a copy of the result into space obtained from
** from [sqlite3_malloc()] before it returns.
**
** The sqlite3_result_value() interface sets the result of
** the application-defined function to be a copy the
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object specified by the 2nd parameter.  The
** sqlite3_result_value() interface makes a copy of the [sqlite3_value]
** so that the [sqlite3_value] specified in the parameter may change or
** be deallocated after sqlite3_result_value() returns without harm.
** A [protected sqlite3_value] object may always be used where an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object is required, so either
** kind of [sqlite3_value] object can be used with this interface.
**
** If these routines are called from within the different thread
** than the one containing the application-defined function that received
** the [sqlite3_context] pointer, the results are undefined.

** CAPI3REF: Define New Collating Sequences {H16600} <S20300>
**
** These functions are used to add new collation sequences to the
** [database connection] specified as the first argument.
**
** The name of the new collation sequence is specified as a UTF-8 string
** for sqlite3_create_collation() and sqlite3_create_collation_v2()
** and a UTF-16 string for sqlite3_create_collation16(). In all cases
** the name is passed as the second function argument.
**
** The third argument may be one of the constants [SQLITE_UTF8],
** [SQLITE_UTF16LE] or [SQLITE_UTF16BE], indicating that the user-supplied
** routine expects to be passed pointers to strings encoded using UTF-8,
** UTF-16 little-endian, or UTF-16 big-endian, respectively. The
** third argument might also be [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] to indicate that
** the routine expects pointers to 16-bit word aligned strings
** of UTF-16 in the native byte order of the host computer.
**
** A pointer to the user supplied routine must be passed as the fifth
** argument.  If it is NULL, this is the same as deleting the collation
** sequence (so that SQLite cannot call it anymore).
** Each time the application supplied function is invoked, it is passed
** as its first parameter a copy of the void* passed as the fourth argument
** to sqlite3_create_collation() or sqlite3_create_collation16().
**
** The remaining arguments to the application-supplied routine are two strings,
** each represented by a (length, data) pair and encoded in the encoding
** that was passed as the third argument when the collation sequence was
** registered. {END}  The application defined collation routine should
** return negative, zero or positive if the first string is less than,
** equal to, or greater than the second string. i.e. (STRING1 - STRING2).
**
** The sqlite3_create_collation_v2() works like sqlite3_create_collation()
** except that it takes an extra argument which is a destructor for
** the collation.  The destructor is called when the collation is
** destroyed and is passed a copy of the fourth parameter void* pointer
** of the sqlite3_create_collation_v2().
** Collations are destroyed when they are overridden by later calls to the
** collation creation functions or when the [database connection] is closed

** pass information into and receive the reply from the xBestIndex
** method of an sqlite3_module.  The fields under **Inputs** are the
** inputs to xBestIndex and are read-only.  xBestIndex inserts its
** results into the **Outputs** fields.
**
** The aConstraint[] array records WHERE clause constraints of the form:
**
** <pre>column OP expr</pre>
**
** where OP is =, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, or &gt;=.  The particular operator is
** stored in aConstraint[].op.  The index of the column is stored in
** aConstraint[].iColumn.  aConstraint[].usable is TRUE if the
** expr on the right-hand side can be evaluated (and thus the constraint
** is usable) and false if it cannot.
**
** The optimizer automatically inverts terms of the form "expr OP column"
** and makes other simplifications to the WHERE clause in an attempt to
** get as many WHERE clause terms into the form shown above as possible.
** The aConstraint[] array only reports WHERE clause terms in the correct
** form that refer to the particular virtual table being queried.
**
** Information about the ORDER BY clause is stored in aOrderBy[].
** Each term of aOrderBy records a column of the ORDER BY clause.
**
** The xBestIndex method must fill aConstraintUsage[] with information
** about what parameters to pass to xFilter.  If argvIndex>0 then
** the right-hand side of the corresponding aConstraint[] is evaluated
** and becomes the argvIndex-th entry in argv.  If aConstraintUsage[].omit
** is true, then the constraint is assumed to be fully handled by the
** virtual table and is not checked again by SQLite.
**
** The idxNum and idxPtr values are recorded and passed into xFilter.
** sqlite3_free() is used to free idxPtr if needToFreeIdxPtr is true.
**
** The orderByConsumed means that output from xFilter will occur in
** the correct order to satisfy the ORDER BY clause so that no separate

** CAPI3REF: Mutexes {H17000} <S20000>
**
** The SQLite core uses these routines for thread
** synchronization. Though they are intended for internal
** use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is
** permitted to use any of these routines.
**
** The SQLite source code contains multiple implementations
** of these mutex routines.  An appropriate implementation
** is selected automatically at compile-time.  The following
** implementations are available in the SQLite core:
**
** <ul>
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_OS2
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREAD
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_W32
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP implementation is a set of routines
** that does no real locking and is appropriate for use in
** a single-threaded application.  The SQLITE_MUTEX_OS2,
** SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREAD, and SQLITE_MUTEX_W32 implementations
** are appropriate for use on OS/2, Unix, and Windows.
**
** If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF preprocessor
** macro defined (with "-DSQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF=1"), then no mutex
** implementation is included with the library. In this case the
** application must supply a custom mutex implementation using the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option of the sqlite3_config() function
** before calling sqlite3_initialize() or any other public sqlite3_
** function that calls sqlite3_initialize().
**
** {H17011} The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it. {H17012} If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated. {H17013} SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error. {H17014} The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM2
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU2
** </ul>
**
** {H17015} The first two constants cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used. {END}
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  {H17016} But SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  {END} If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** {H17017} The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex. {END}  Four static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** {H17018} Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  {H17034} But for the static
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has
** the same type number.
**
** {H17019} The sqlite3_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
** allocated dynamic mutex. {H17020} SQLite is careful to deallocate every
** dynamic mutex that it allocates. {A17021} The dynamic mutexes must not be in
** use when they are deallocated. {A17022} Attempting to deallocate a static
** mutex results in undefined behavior. {H17023} SQLite never deallocates
** a static mutex. {END}
**
** The sqlite3_mutex_enter() and sqlite3_mutex_try() routines attempt
** to enter a mutex. {H17024} If another thread is already within the mutex,
** sqlite3_mutex_enter() will block and sqlite3_mutex_try() will return
** SQLITE_BUSY. {H17025}  The sqlite3_mutex_try() interface returns [SQLITE_OK]
** upon successful entry.  {H17026} Mutexes created using
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE can be entered multiple times by the same thread.
** {H17027} In such cases the,
** mutex must be exited an equal number of times before another thread
** can enter.  {A17028} If the same thread tries to enter any other
** kind of mutex more than once, the behavior is undefined.
** {H17029} SQLite will never exhibit
** such behavior in its own use of mutexes.
**
** Some systems (for example, Windows 95) do not support the operation
** implemented by sqlite3_mutex_try().  On those systems, sqlite3_mutex_try()
** will always return SQLITE_BUSY.  {H17030} The SQLite core only ever uses
** sqlite3_mutex_try() as an optimization so this is acceptable behavior.
**
** {H17031} The sqlite3_mutex_leave() routine exits a mutex that was
** previously entered by the same thread.  {A17032} The behavior
** is undefined if the mutex is not currently entered by the
** calling thread or is not currently allocated.  {H17033} SQLite will
** never do either. {END}
**
** If the argument to sqlite3_mutex_enter(), sqlite3_mutex_try(), or
** sqlite3_mutex_leave() is a NULL pointer, then all three routines
** behave as no-ops.

** Usually, the default mutex implementations provided by SQLite are
** sufficient, however the user has the option of substituting a custom
** implementation for specialized deployments or systems for which SQLite
** does not provide a suitable implementation. In this case, the user
** creates and populates an instance of this structure to pass
** to sqlite3_config() along with the [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option.
** Additionally, an instance of this structure can be used as an
** output variable when querying the system for the current mutex
** implementation, using the [SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMUTEX] option.
**
** The xMutexInit method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system initialization by the sqlite3_initialize() function.
** {H17001} The xMutexInit routine shall be called by SQLite once for each
** effective call to [sqlite3_initialize()].
**
** The xMutexEnd method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system shutdown by the sqlite3_shutdown() function. The
** implementation of this method is expected to release all outstanding
** resources obtained by the mutex methods implementation, especially
** those obtained by the xMutexInit method. {H17003} The xMutexEnd()
** interface shall be invoked once for each call to [sqlite3_shutdown()].
**
** The remaining seven methods defined by this structure (xMutexAlloc,
** xMutexFree, xMutexEnter, xMutexTry, xMutexLeave, xMutexHeld and
** xMutexNotheld) implement the following interfaces (respectively):
**

**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_notheld()] </li>
** </ul>
**
** The only difference is that the public sqlite3_XXX functions enumerated
** above silently ignore any invocations that pass a NULL pointer instead
** of a valid mutex handle. The implementations of the methods defined
** by this structure are not required to handle this case, the results

/*
** CAPI3REF: Application Defined Page Cache.
** EXPERIMENTAL
**
** The [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE], ...) interface can
** register an alternative page cache implementation by passing in an 
** instance of the sqlite3_pcache_methods structure. The majority of the 
** heap memory used by sqlite is used by the page cache to cache data read 
** from, or ready to be written to, the database file. By implementing a 
** custom page cache using this API, an application can control more 
** precisely the amount of memory consumed by sqlite, the way in which 
** said memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to 
** determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for 
** how long.
**
** The contents of the structure are copied to an internal buffer by sqlite
** within the call to [sqlite3_config].
**
** The xInit() method is called once for each call to [sqlite3_initialize()]
** (usually only once during the lifetime of the process). It is passed
** a copy of the sqlite3_pcache_methods.pArg value. It can be used to set
** up global structures and mutexes required by the custom page cache 
** implementation. The xShutdown() method is called from within 
** [sqlite3_shutdown()], if the application invokes this API. It can be used
** to clean up any outstanding resources before process shutdown, if required.
**
** The xCreate() method is used to construct a new cache instance. The
** first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must
** be allocated by the cache. szPage will not be a power of two. The
** second argument, bPurgeable, is true if the cache being created will
** be used to cache database pages read from a file stored on disk, or
** false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
** does not have to do anything special based on the value of bPurgeable,
** it is purely advisory. 
**
** The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
** suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
** instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
** the SQLite "[PRAGMA cache_size]" command. As with the bPurgeable parameter,
** the implementation is not required to do anything special with this
** value, it is advisory only.
**
** The xPagecount() method should return the number of pages currently
** stored in the cache supplied as an argument.
** 
** The xFetch() method is used to fetch a page and return a pointer to it. 
** A 'page', in this context, is a buffer of szPage bytes aligned at an
** 8-byte boundary. The page to be fetched is determined by the key. The
** mimimum key value is 1. After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page 
** is considered to be pinned.
**
** If the requested page is already in the page cache, then a pointer to
** the cached buffer should be returned with its contents intact. If the
** page is not already in the cache, then the expected behaviour of the
** cache is determined by the value of the createFlag parameter passed
** to xFetch, according to the following table:
**
** <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
**   <tr><th>createFlag<th>Expected Behaviour
**   <tr><td>0<td>NULL should be returned. No new cache entry is created.
**   <tr><td>1<td>If createFlag is set to 1, this indicates that 
**                SQLite is holding pinned pages that can be unpinned
**                by writing their contents to the database file (a
**                relatively expensive operation). In this situation the
**                cache implementation has two choices: it can return NULL,
**                in which case SQLite will attempt to unpin one or more 
**                pages before re-requesting the same page, or it can
**                allocate a new page and return a pointer to it. If a new
**                page is allocated, then the first sizeof(void*) bytes of
**                it (at least) must be zeroed before it is returned.
**   <tr><td>2<td>If createFlag is set to 2, then SQLite is not holding any
**                pinned pages associated with the specific cache passed
**                as the first argument to xFetch() that can be unpinned. The
**                cache implementation should attempt to allocate a new
**                cache entry and return a pointer to it. Again, the first
**                sizeof(void*) bytes of the page should be zeroed before 
**                it is returned. If the xFetch() method returns NULL when 
**                createFlag==2, SQLite assumes that a memory allocation 
**                failed and returns SQLITE_NOMEM to the user.
** </table>
**
** xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
** as its second argument. If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
** then the page should be evicted from the cache. In this case SQLite 
** assumes that the next time the page is retrieved from the cache using
** the xFetch() method, it will be zeroed. If the discard parameter is
** zero, then the page is considered to be unpinned. The cache implementation
** may choose to reclaim (free or recycle) unpinned pages at any time.
** SQLite assumes that next time the page is retrieved from the cache
** it will either be zeroed, or contain the same data that it did when it
** was unpinned.
**
** The cache is not required to perform any reference counting. A single 
** call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls 
** to xFetch().
**
** The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
** page passed as the second argument from oldKey to newKey. If the cache
** previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it should be
** discarded. Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
** to be pinned.
**
** When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
** existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal
** to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate(). If any
** of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
** they can be safely discarded.
**
** The xDestroy() method is used to delete a cache allocated by xCreate().
** All resources associated with the specified cache should be freed. After
** calling the xDestroy() method, SQLite considers the [sqlite3_pcache*]
** handle invalid, and will not use it with any other sqlite3_pcache_methods
** functions.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Online Backup API.
** EXPERIMENTAL
**
** This API is used to overwrite the contents of one database with that
** of another. It is useful either for creating backups of databases or
** for copying in-memory databases to or from persistent files. 
**
** See Also: [Using the SQLite Online Backup API]
**
** Exclusive access is required to the destination database for the 
** duration of the operation. However the source database is only
** read-locked while it is actually being read, it is not locked
** continuously for the entire operation. Thus, the backup may be
** performed on a live database without preventing other users from
** writing to the database for an extended period of time.
** 
** To perform a backup operation: 
**   <ol>
**     <li><b>sqlite3_backup_init()</b> is called once to initialize the
**         backup, 
**     <li><b>sqlite3_backup_step()</b> is called one or more times to transfer 
**         the data between the two databases, and finally
**     <li><b>sqlite3_backup_finish()</b> is called to release all resources 
**         associated with the backup operation. 
**   </ol>
** There should be exactly one call to sqlite3_backup_finish() for each
** successful call to sqlite3_backup_init().
**
** <b>sqlite3_backup_init()</b>
**
** The first two arguments passed to [sqlite3_backup_init()] are the database
** handle associated with the destination database and the database name 
** used to attach the destination database to the handle. The database name
** is "main" for the main database, "temp" for the temporary database, or
** the name specified as part of the [ATTACH] statement if the destination is
** an attached database. The third and fourth arguments passed to 
** sqlite3_backup_init() identify the [database connection]
** and database name used
** to access the source database. The values passed for the source and 
** destination [database connection] parameters must not be the same.
**
** If an error occurs within sqlite3_backup_init(), then NULL is returned
** and an error code and error message written into the [database connection] 
** passed as the first argument. They may be retrieved using the
** [sqlite3_errcode()], [sqlite3_errmsg()], and [sqlite3_errmsg16()] functions.
** Otherwise, if successful, a pointer to an [sqlite3_backup] object is
** returned. This pointer may be used with the sqlite3_backup_step() and
** sqlite3_backup_finish() functions to perform the specified backup 
** operation.
**
** <b>sqlite3_backup_step()</b>
**
** Function [sqlite3_backup_step()] is used to copy up to nPage pages between 
** the source and destination databases, where nPage is the value of the 
** second parameter passed to sqlite3_backup_step(). If nPage is a negative
** value, all remaining source pages are copied. If the required pages are 
** succesfully copied, but there are still more pages to copy before the 
** backup is complete, it returns [SQLITE_OK]. If no error occured and there 
** are no more pages to copy, then [SQLITE_DONE] is returned. If an error 
** occurs, then an SQLite error code is returned. As well as [SQLITE_OK] and
** [SQLITE_DONE], a call to sqlite3_backup_step() may return [SQLITE_READONLY],
** [SQLITE_NOMEM], [SQLITE_BUSY], [SQLITE_LOCKED], or an
** [SQLITE_IOERR_ACCESS | SQLITE_IOERR_XXX] extended error code.
**
** As well as the case where the destination database file was opened for
** read-only access, sqlite3_backup_step() may return [SQLITE_READONLY] if
** the destination is an in-memory database with a different page size
** from the source database.
**
** If sqlite3_backup_step() cannot obtain a required file-system lock, then
** the [sqlite3_busy_handler | busy-handler function]
** is invoked (if one is specified). If the 
** busy-handler returns non-zero before the lock is available, then 
** [SQLITE_BUSY] is returned to the caller. In this case the call to
** sqlite3_backup_step() can be retried later. If the source
** [database connection]
** is being used to write to the source database when sqlite3_backup_step()
** is called, then [SQLITE_LOCKED] is returned immediately. Again, in this
** case the call to sqlite3_backup_step() can be retried later on. If
** [SQLITE_IOERR_ACCESS | SQLITE_IOERR_XXX], [SQLITE_NOMEM], or
** [SQLITE_READONLY] is returned, then 
** there is no point in retrying the call to sqlite3_backup_step(). These 
** errors are considered fatal. At this point the application must accept 
** that the backup operation has failed and pass the backup operation handle 
** to the sqlite3_backup_finish() to release associated resources.
**
** Following the first call to sqlite3_backup_step(), an exclusive lock is
** obtained on the destination file. It is not released until either 
** sqlite3_backup_finish() is called or the backup operation is complete 
** and sqlite3_backup_step() returns [SQLITE_DONE]. Additionally, each time 
** a call to sqlite3_backup_step() is made a [shared lock] is obtained on
** the source database file. This lock is released before the
** sqlite3_backup_step() call returns. Because the source database is not
** locked between calls to sqlite3_backup_step(), it may be modified mid-way
** through the backup procedure. If the source database is modified by an
** external process or via a database connection other than the one being
** used by the backup operation, then the backup will be transparently
** restarted by the next call to sqlite3_backup_step(). If the source 
** database is modified by the using the same database connection as is used
** by the backup operation, then the backup database is transparently 
** updated at the same time.
**
** <b>sqlite3_backup_finish()</b>
**
** Once sqlite3_backup_step() has returned [SQLITE_DONE], or when the 
** application wishes to abandon the backup operation, the [sqlite3_backup]
** object should be passed to sqlite3_backup_finish(). This releases all
** resources associated with the backup operation. If sqlite3_backup_step()
** has not yet returned [SQLITE_DONE], then any active write-transaction on the
** destination database is rolled back. The [sqlite3_backup] object is invalid
** and may not be used following a call to sqlite3_backup_finish().
**
** The value returned by sqlite3_backup_finish is [SQLITE_OK] if no error
** occurred, regardless or whether or not sqlite3_backup_step() was called
** a sufficient number of times to complete the backup operation. Or, if
** an out-of-memory condition or IO error occured during a call to
** sqlite3_backup_step() then [SQLITE_NOMEM] or an
** [SQLITE_IOERR_ACCESS | SQLITE_IOERR_XXX] error code
** is returned. In this case the error code and an error message are
** written to the destination [database connection].
**
** A return of [SQLITE_BUSY] or [SQLITE_LOCKED] from sqlite3_backup_step() is
** not a permanent error and does not affect the return value of
** sqlite3_backup_finish().
**
** <b>sqlite3_backup_remaining(), sqlite3_backup_pagecount()</b>
**
** Each call to sqlite3_backup_step() sets two values stored internally
** by an [sqlite3_backup] object. The number of pages still to be backed
** up, which may be queried by sqlite3_backup_remaining(), and the total
** number of pages in the source database file, which may be queried by
** sqlite3_backup_pagecount().
**
** The values returned by these functions are only updated by
** sqlite3_backup_step(). If the source database is modified during a backup
** operation, then the values are not updated to account for any extra
** pages that need to be updated or the size of the source database file
** changing.
**
** <b>Concurrent Usage of Database Handles</b>
**
** The source [database connection] may be used by the application for other
** purposes while a backup operation is underway or being initialized.
** If SQLite is compiled and configured to support threadsafe database
** connections, then the source database connection may be used concurrently
** from within other threads.
**
** However, the application must guarantee that the destination database
** connection handle is not passed to any other API (by any thread) after 
** sqlite3_backup_init() is called and before the corresponding call to
** sqlite3_backup_finish(). Unfortunately SQLite does not currently check
** for this, if the application does use the destination [database connection]
** for some other purpose during a backup operation, things may appear to
** work correctly but in fact be subtly malfunctioning.  Use of the
** destination database connection while a backup is in progress might
** also cause a mutex deadlock.
**
** Furthermore, if running in [shared cache mode], the application must
** guarantee that the shared cache used by the destination database
** is not accessed while the backup is running. In practice this means
** that the application must guarantee that the file-system file being 
** backed up to is not accessed by any connection within the process,
** not just the specific connection that was passed to sqlite3_backup_init().
**
** The [sqlite3_backup] object itself is partially threadsafe. Multiple 
** threads may safely make multiple concurrent calls to sqlite3_backup_step().
** However, the sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount()
** APIs are not strictly speaking threadsafe. If they are invoked at the
** same time as another thread is invoking sqlite3_backup_step() it is
** possible that they return invalid values.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Unlock Notification
** EXPERIMENTAL
**
** When running in shared-cache mode, a database operation may fail with
** an [SQLITE_LOCKED] error if the required locks on the shared-cache or
** individual tables within the shared-cache cannot be obtained. See
** [SQLite Shared-Cache Mode] for a description of shared-cache locking. 
** This API may be used to register a callback that SQLite will invoke 
** when the connection currently holding the required lock relinquishes it.
** This API is only available if the library was compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY] C-preprocessor symbol defined.
**
** See Also: [Using the SQLite Unlock Notification Feature].
**
** Shared-cache locks are released when a database connection concludes
** its current transaction, either by committing it or rolling it back. 
**
** When a connection (known as the blocked connection) fails to obtain a
** shared-cache lock and SQLITE_LOCKED is returned to the caller, the
** identity of the database connection (the blocking connection) that
** has locked the required resource is stored internally. After an 
** application receives an SQLITE_LOCKED error, it may call the
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() method with the blocked connection handle as 
** the first argument to register for a callback that will be invoked
** when the blocking connections current transaction is concluded. The
** callback is invoked from within the [sqlite3_step] or [sqlite3_close]
** call that concludes the blocking connections transaction.
**
** If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called in a multi-threaded application,
** there is a chance that the blocking connection will have already
** concluded its transaction by the time sqlite3_unlock_notify() is invoked.
** If this happens, then the specified callback is invoked immediately,
** from within the call to sqlite3_unlock_notify().
**
** If the blocked connection is attempting to obtain a write-lock on a
** shared-cache table, and more than one other connection currently holds
** a read-lock on the same table, then SQLite arbitrarily selects one of 
** the other connections to use as the blocking connection.
**
** There may be at most one unlock-notify callback registered by a 
** blocked connection. If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called when the
** blocked connection already has a registered unlock-notify callback,
** then the new callback replaces the old. If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is
** called with a NULL pointer as its second argument, then any existing
** unlock-notify callback is cancelled. The blocked connections 
** unlock-notify callback may also be canceled by closing the blocked
** connection using [sqlite3_close()].
**
** The unlock-notify callback is not reentrant. If an application invokes
** any sqlite3_xxx API functions from within an unlock-notify callback, a
** crash or deadlock may be the result.
**
** Unless deadlock is detected (see below), sqlite3_unlock_notify() always
** returns SQLITE_OK.
**
** <b>Callback Invocation Details</b>
**
** When an unlock-notify callback is registered, the application provides a 
** single void* pointer that is passed to the callback when it is invoked.
** However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass
** it an array of void* context pointers. The first argument passed to
** an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers,
** and the second is the number of entries in the array.
**
** When a blocking connections transaction is concluded, there may be
** more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback. If two or more such blocked connections have specified the
** same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function
** multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers
** specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array.
** This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions 
** related to the set of unblocked database connections.
**
** <b>Deadlock Detection</b>
**
** Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a 
** database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further
** action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the
** application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for
** connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection
** Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection
** will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
**
** To avoid this scenario, the sqlite3_unlock_notify() performs deadlock
** detection. If a given call to sqlite3_unlock_notify() would put the
** system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE_LOCKED is returned and no
** unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in
** a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection
** B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection
** A's transaction is concluded. Indirect deadlock is also detected, so
** the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has
** registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection
** C's transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A. Any
** number of levels of indirection are allowed.
**
** <b>The "DROP TABLE" Exception</b>
**
** When a call to [sqlite3_step()] returns SQLITE_LOCKED, it is almost 
** always appropriate to call sqlite3_unlock_notify(). There is however,
** one exception. When executing a "DROP TABLE" or "DROP INDEX" statement,
** SQLite checks if there are any currently executing SELECT statements
** that belong to the same connection. If there are, SQLITE_LOCKED is
** returned. In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being
** invoked immediately. If the application then re-attempts the "DROP TABLE"
** or "DROP INDEX" query, an infinite loop might be the result.
**
** One way around this problem is to check the extended error code returned
** by an sqlite3_step() call. If there is a blocking connection, then the
** extended error code is set to SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE. Otherwise, in
** the special "DROP TABLE/INDEX" case, the extended error code is just 
** SQLITE_LOCKED.

** File Locking Notes:  (Mostly about windows but also some info for Unix)
**
** We cannot use LockFileEx() or UnlockFileEx() on Win95/98/ME because
** those functions are not available.  So we use only LockFile() and
** UnlockFile().
**
** LockFile() prevents not just writing but also reading by other processes.
** A SHARED_LOCK is obtained by locking a single randomly-chosen 
** byte out of a specific range of bytes. The lock byte is obtained at 
** random so two separate readers can probably access the file at the 
** same time, unless they are unlucky and choose the same lock byte.
** An EXCLUSIVE_LOCK is obtained by locking all bytes in the range.
** There can only be one writer.  A RESERVED_LOCK is obtained by locking
** a single byte of the file that is designated as the reserved lock byte.
** A PENDING_LOCK is obtained by locking a designated byte different from
** the RESERVED_LOCK byte.
**
** On WinNT/2K/XP systems, LockFileEx() and UnlockFileEx() are available,
** which means we can use reader/writer locks.  When reader/writer locks
** are used, the lock is placed on the same range of bytes that is used
** for probabilistic locking in Win95/98/ME.  Hence, the locking scheme
** will support two or more Win95 readers or two or more WinNT readers.
** But a single Win95 reader will lock out all WinNT readers and a single
** WinNT reader will lock out all other Win95 readers.
**
** The following #defines specify the range of bytes used for locking.
** SHARED_SIZE is the number of bytes available in the pool from which
** a random byte is selected for a shared lock.  The pool of bytes for
** shared locks begins at SHARED_FIRST. 
**
** The same locking strategy and
** byte ranges are used for Unix.  This leaves open the possiblity of having
** clients on win95, winNT, and unix all talking to the same shared file
** and all locking correctly.  To do so would require that samba (or whatever
** tool is being used for file sharing) implements locks correctly between
** windows and unix.  I'm guessing that isn't likely to happen, but by
** using the same locking range we are at least open to the possibility.
**
** Locking in windows is manditory.  For this reason, we cannot store
** actual data in the bytes used for locking.  The pager never allocates
** the pages involved in locking therefore.  SHARED_SIZE is selected so
** that all locks will fit on a single page even at the minimum page size.
** PENDING_BYTE defines the beginning of the locks.  By default PENDING_BYTE
** is set high so that we don't have to allocate an unused page except
** for very large databases.  But one should test the page skipping logic 
** by setting PENDING_BYTE low and running the entire regression suite.
**
** Changing the value of PENDING_BYTE results in a subtly incompatible
** file format.  Depending on how it is changed, you might not notice
** the incompatibility right away, even running a full regression test.
** The default location of PENDING_BYTE is the first byte past the
** 1GB boundary.

** code representing the ">=" operator. This same integer code is reused
** to represent the greater-than-or-equal-to operator in the expression
** tree.
**
** If the expression is an SQL literal (TK_INTEGER, TK_FLOAT, TK_BLOB, 
** or TK_STRING), then Expr.token contains the text of the SQL literal. If
** the expression is a variable (TK_VARIABLE), then Expr.token contains the 
** variable name. Finally, if the expression is an SQL function (TK_FUNCTION),
** then Expr.token contains the name of the function.
**
** Expr.pRight and Expr.pLeft are the left and right subexpressions of a
** binary operator. Either or both may be NULL.
**
** Expr.x.pList is a list of arguments if the expression is an SQL function,
** a CASE expression or an IN expression of the form "<lhs> IN (<y>, <z>...)".
** Expr.x.pSelect is used if the expression is a sub-select or an expression of
** the form "<lhs> IN (SELECT ...)". If the EP_xIsSelect bit is set in the
** Expr.flags mask, then Expr.x.pSelect is valid. Otherwise, Expr.x.pList is 
** valid.
**
** An expression of the form ID or ID.ID refers to a column in a table.
** For such expressions, Expr.op is set to TK_COLUMN and Expr.iTable is
** the integer cursor number of a VDBE cursor pointing to that table and
** Expr.iColumn is the column number for the specific column.  If the
** expression is used as a result in an aggregate SELECT, then the
** value is also stored in the Expr.iAgg column in the aggregate so that
** it can be accessed after all aggregates are computed.
**
** If the expression is an unbound variable marker (a question mark 
** character '?' in the original SQL) then the Expr.iTable holds the index 
** number for that variable.
**
** If the expression is a subquery then Expr.iColumn holds an integer
** register number containing the result of the subquery.  If the
** subquery gives a constant result, then iTable is -1.  If the subquery
** gives a different answer at different times during statement processing
** then iTable is the address of a subroutine that computes the subquery.
**
** If the Expr is of type OP_Column, and the table it is selecting from
** is a disk table or the "old.*" pseudo-table, then pTab points to the
** corresponding table definition.

** ALLOCATION NOTES:
**
** Expr objects can use a lot of memory space in database schema.  To
** help reduce memory requirements, sometimes an Expr object will be
** truncated.  And to reduce the number of memory allocations, sometimes
** two or more Expr objects will be stored in a single memory allocation,
** together with Expr.token and/or Expr.span strings.
**
** If the EP_Reduced, EP_SpanToken, and EP_TokenOnly flags are set when
** an Expr object is truncated.  When EP_Reduced is set, then all
** the child Expr objects in the Expr.pLeft and Expr.pRight subtrees

 * each nested trigger stores its parent trigger's TriggerStack as the "pNext" 
 * pointer. Once the nested trigger has been coded, the pNext value is restored
 * to the pTriggerStack member of the Parse stucture and coding of the parent
 * trigger continues.

**   toupper()                        0x20

** If x is a lower-case ASCII character, then its upper-case equivalent

** Standard function tolower() is implemented using the sqlite3UpperToLower[]

** are made and returned by the xMalloc() and xRealloc() 
** implementations. Once sqlite3_initialize() has been called,
** the amount of memory available to SQLite is fixed and cannot
** be changed.
**
** This version of the memory allocation subsystem is included
** in the build only if SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMSYS3 is defined.

/*
** A memory allocation (also called a "chunk") consists of two or 
** more blocks where each block is 8 bytes.  The first 8 bytes are 
** a header that is not returned to the user.
**
** A chunk is two or more blocks that is either checked out or
** free.  The first block has format u.hdr.  u.hdr.size4x is 4 times the
** size of the allocation in blocks if the allocation is free.
** The u.hdr.size4x&1 bit is true if the chunk is checked out and
** false if the chunk is on the freelist.  The u.hdr.size4x&2 bit
** is true if the previous chunk is checked out and false if the
** previous chunk is free.  The u.hdr.prevSize field is the size of
** the previous chunk in blocks if the previous chunk is on the
** freelist. If the previous chunk is checked out, then
** u.hdr.prevSize can be part of the data for that chunk and should
** not be read or written.
**
** We often identify a chunk by its index in mem3.aPool[].  When
** this is done, the chunk index refers to the second block of
** the chunk.  In this way, the first chunk has an index of 1.
** A chunk index of 0 means "no such chunk" and is the equivalent
** of a NULL pointer.
**
** The second block of free chunks is of the form u.list.  The
** two fields form a double-linked list of chunks of related sizes.
** Pointers to the head of the list are stored in mem3.aiSmall[] 
** for smaller chunks and mem3.aiHash[] for larger chunks.
**
** The second block of a chunk is user data if the chunk is checked 
** out.  If a chunk is checked out, the user data may extend into
** the u.hdr.prevSize value of the following chunk.

** The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it.  If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated.  SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error.  The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST               0
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE          1
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER      2
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM         3
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG        4
** </ul>
**
** The first two constants cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used.
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  But SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex.  Three static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  But for the static 
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has

** The following modules is an enhanced replacement for the "printf" subroutines
** found in the standard C library.  The following enhancements are
** supported:
**
**      +  Additional functions.  The standard set of "printf" functions
**         includes printf, fprintf, sprintf, vprintf, vfprintf, and
**         vsprintf.  This module adds the following:
**
**           *  snprintf -- Works like sprintf, but has an extra argument
**                          which is the size of the buffer written to.
**
**           *  mprintf --  Similar to sprintf.  Writes output to memory
**                          obtained from malloc.
**
**           *  xprintf --  Calls a function to dispose of output.
**
**           *  nprintf --  No output, but returns the number of characters
**                          that would have been output by printf.
**
**           *  A v- version (ex: vsnprintf) of every function is also
**              supplied.
**
**      +  A few extensions to the formatting notation are supported:
**
**           *  The "=" flag (similar to "-") causes the output to be
**              be centered in the appropriately sized field.
**
**           *  The %b field outputs an integer in binary notation.
**
**           *  The %c field now accepts a precision.  The character output
**              is repeated by the number of times the precision specifies.
**
**           *  The %' field works like %c, but takes as its character the
**              next character of the format string, instead of the next
**              argument.  For example,  printf("%.78'-")  prints 78 minus
**              signs, the same as  printf("%.78c",'-').
**
**      +  When compiled using GCC on a SPARC, this version of printf is
**         faster than the library printf for SUN OS 4.1.
**
**      +  All functions are fully reentrant.

**   func   This is a pointer to a function taking three arguments
**            1. A pointer to anything.  Same as the "arg" parameter.
**            2. A pointer to the list of characters to be output
**               (Note, this list is NOT null terminated.)
**            3. An integer number of characters to be output.
**               (Note: This number might be zero.)
**
**   arg    This is the pointer to anything which will be passed as the
**          first argument to "func".  Use it for whatever you like.
**
**   fmt    This is the format string, as in the usual print.
**
**   ap     This is a pointer to a list of arguments.  Same as in
**          vfprint.
**
** OUTPUTS:
**          The return value is the total number of characters sent to
**          the function "func".  Returns -1 on a error.
**
** Note that the order in which automatic variables are declared below

**
** Notes On Invalid UTF-8:
**
**  *  This routine never allows a 7-bit character (0x00 through 0x7f) to
**     be encoded as a multi-byte character.  Any multi-byte character that

**
**  *  This routine never allows a UTF16 surrogate value to be encoded.
**     If a multi-byte character attempts to encode a value between
**     0xd800 and 0xe000 then it is rendered as 0xfffd.
**
**  *  Bytes in the range of 0x80 through 0xbf which occur as the first
**     byte of a character are interpreted as single-byte characters
**     and rendered as themselves even though they are technically
**     invalid characters.
**
**  *  This routine accepts an infinite number of different UTF8 encodings
**     for unicode values 0x80 and greater.  It do not change over-length

/*
** A Note About Memory Allocation:
**
** This driver uses malloc()/free() directly rather than going through
** the SQLite-wrappers sqlite3_malloc()/sqlite3_free().  Those wrappers
** are designed for use on embedded systems where memory is scarce and
** malloc failures happen frequently.  OS/2 does not typically run on
** embedded systems, and when it does the developers normally have bigger
** problems to worry about than running out of memory.  So there is not
** a compelling need to use the wrappers.
**
** But there is a good reason to not use the wrappers.  If we use the
** wrappers then we will get simulated malloc() failures within this
** driver.  And that causes all kinds of problems for our tests.  We
** could enhance SQLite to deal with simulated malloc failures within
** the OS driver, but the code to deal with those failure would not
** be exercised on Linux (which does not need to malloc() in the driver)
** and so we would have difficulty writing coverage tests for that
** code.  Better to leave the code out, we think.
**
** The point of this discussion is as follows:  When creating a new
** OS layer for an embedded system, if you use this file as an example,
** avoid the use of malloc()/free().  Those routines work ok on OS/2
** desktops but not so well in embedded systems.

** in the correct division and should be clearly labeled.
**
** The layout of divisions is as follows:
**
**   *  General-purpose declarations and utility functions.
**   *  Unique file ID logic used by VxWorks.
**   *  Various locking primitive implementations (all except proxy locking):
**      + for Posix Advisory Locks
**      + for no-op locks
**      + for dot-file locks
**      + for flock() locking
**      + for named semaphore locks (VxWorks only)
**      + for AFP filesystem locks (MacOSX only)
**   *  sqlite3_file methods not associated with locking.

/******************************************************************************
*************************** Posix Advisory Locking ****************************
**
** POSIX advisory locks are broken by design.  ANSI STD 1003.1 (1996)
** section 6.5.2.2 lines 483 through 490 specify that when a process
** sets or clears a lock, that operation overrides any prior locks set
** by the same process.  It does not explicitly say so, but this implies
** that it overrides locks set by the same process using a different
** file descriptor.  Consider this test case:
**
**       int fd1 = open("./file1", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644);
**       int fd2 = open("./file2", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644);
**
** Suppose ./file1 and ./file2 are really the same file (because
** one is a hard or symbolic link to the other) then if you set
** an exclusive lock on fd1, then try to get an exclusive lock
** on fd2, it works.  I would have expected the second lock to
** fail since there was already a lock on the file due to fd1.
** But not so.  Since both locks came from the same process, the
** second overrides the first, even though they were on different
** file descriptors opened on different file names.
**
** This means that we cannot use POSIX locks to synchronize file access
** among competing threads of the same process.  POSIX locks will work fine
** to synchronize access for threads in separate processes, but not
** threads within the same process.
**
** To work around the problem, SQLite has to manage file locks internally
** on its own.  Whenever a new database is opened, we have to find the
** specific inode of the database file (the inode is determined by the
** st_dev and st_ino fields of the stat structure that fstat() fills in)
** and check for locks already existing on that inode.  When locks are
** created or removed, we have to look at our own internal record of the
** locks to see if another thread has previously set a lock on that same
** inode.
**
** (Aside: The use of inode numbers as unique IDs does not work on VxWorks.
** For VxWorks, we have to use the alternative unique ID system based on
** canonical filename and implemented in the previous division.)
**
** The sqlite3_file structure for POSIX is no longer just an integer file
** descriptor.  It is now a structure that holds the integer file
** descriptor and a pointer to a structure that describes the internal
** locks on the corresponding inode.  There is one locking structure
** per inode, so if the same inode is opened twice, both unixFile structures
** point to the same locking structure.  The locking structure keeps
** a reference count (so we will know when to delete it) and a "cnt"
** field that tells us its internal lock status.  cnt==0 means the
** file is unlocked.  cnt==-1 means the file has an exclusive lock.
** cnt>0 means there are cnt shared locks on the file.
**
** Any attempt to lock or unlock a file first checks the locking
** structure.  The fcntl() system call is only invoked to set a 
** POSIX lock if the internal lock structure transitions between
** a locked and an unlocked state.
**
** But wait:  there are yet more problems with POSIX advisory locks.
**
** If you close a file descriptor that points to a file that has locks,
** all locks on that file that are owned by the current process are
** released.  To work around this problem, each unixFile structure contains
** a pointer to an unixOpenCnt structure.  There is one unixOpenCnt structure
** per open inode, which means that multiple unixFile can point to a single
** unixOpenCnt.  When an attempt is made to close an unixFile, if there are
** other unixFile open on the same inode that are holding locks, the call
** to close() the file descriptor is deferred until all of the locks clear.
** The unixOpenCnt structure keeps a list of file descriptors that need to
** be closed and that list is walked (and cleared) when the last lock
** clears.
**
** Yet another problem:  LinuxThreads do not play well with posix locks.
**
** Many older versions of linux use the LinuxThreads library which is
** not posix compliant.  Under LinuxThreads, a lock created by thread
** A cannot be modified or overridden by a different thread B.
** Only thread A can modify the lock.  Locking behavior is correct
** if the appliation uses the newer Native Posix Thread Library (NPTL)
** on linux - with NPTL a lock created by thread A can override locks
** in thread B.  But there is no way to know at compile-time which
** threading library is being used.  So there is no way to know at
** compile-time whether or not thread A can override locks on thread B.
** We have to do a run-time check to discover the behavior of the
** current process.
**
** On systems where thread A is unable to modify locks created by
** thread B, we have to keep track of which thread created each
** lock.  Hence there is an extra field in the key to the unixLockInfo
** structure to record this information.  And on those systems it
** is illegal to begin a transaction in one thread and finish it
** in another.  For this latter restriction, there is no work-around.
** It is a limitation of LinuxThreads.
*/

  ** confusion with SQLite lock names). The algorithms are complicated
  ** slightly in order to be compatible with windows systems simultaneously
  ** accessing the same database file, in case that is ever required.
  **
  ** Symbols defined in os.h indentify the 'pending byte' and the 'reserved
  ** byte', each single bytes at well known offsets, and the 'shared byte
  ** range', a range of 510 bytes at a well known offset.
  **
  ** To obtain a SHARED lock, a read-lock is obtained on the 'pending
  ** byte'.  If this is successful, a random byte from the 'shared byte
  ** range' is read-locked and the lock on the 'pending byte' released.
  **
  ** A process may only obtain a RESERVED lock after it has a SHARED lock.
  ** A RESERVED lock is implemented by grabbing a write-lock on the
  ** 'reserved byte'. 
  **
  ** A process may only obtain a PENDING lock after it has obtained a
  ** SHARED lock. A PENDING lock is implemented by obtaining a write-lock
  ** on the 'pending byte'. This ensures that no new SHARED locks can be
  ** obtained, but existing SHARED locks are allowed to persist. A process
  ** does not have to obtain a RESERVED lock on the way to a PENDING lock.
  ** This property is used by the algorithm for rolling back a journal file
  ** after a crash.
  **
  ** An EXCLUSIVE lock, obtained after a PENDING lock is held, is
  ** implemented by obtaining a write-lock on the entire 'shared byte
  ** range'. Since all other locks require a read-lock on one of the bytes
  ** within this range, this ensures that no other locks are held on the
  ** database. 
  **
  ** The reason a single byte cannot be used instead of the 'shared byte
  ** range' is that some versions of windows do not support read-locks. By
  ** locking a random byte from a range, concurrent SHARED locks may exist
  ** even if the locking primitive used is always a write-lock.

**
**    (1)  There is zero concurrency.  A single reader blocks all other

**
**    (2)  An application crash or power loss can leave stale lock files
**         sitting around that need to be cleared manually.
**
** Nevertheless, a dotlock is an appropriate locking mode for use if no
** other locking strategy is available.
**
** Dotfile locking works by creating a file in the same directory as the
** database and with the same name but with a ".lock" extension added.
** The existance of a lock file implies an EXCLUSIVE lock.  All other lock
** types (SHARED, RESERVED, PENDING) are mapped into EXCLUSIVE.

/******************************************************************************
************************** Begin Proxy Locking ********************************
**
** Proxy locking is a "uber-locking-method" in this sense:  It uses the
** other locking methods on secondary lock files.  Proxy locking is a
** meta-layer over top of the primitive locking implemented above.  For
** this reason, the division that implements of proxy locking is deferred
** until late in the file (here) after all of the other I/O methods have
** been defined - so that the primitive locking methods are available
** as services to help with the implementation of proxy locking.
**
****
**
** The default locking schemes in SQLite use byte-range locks on the
** database file to coordinate safe, concurrent access by multiple readers
** and writers [http://sqlite.org/lockingv3.html].  The five file locking
** states (UNLOCKED, PENDING, SHARED, RESERVED, EXCLUSIVE) are implemented
** as POSIX read & write locks over fixed set of locations (via fsctl),
** on AFP and SMB only exclusive byte-range locks are available via fsctl
** with _IOWR('z', 23, struct ByteRangeLockPB2) to track the same 5 states.
** To simulate a F_RDLCK on the shared range, on AFP a randomly selected
** address in the shared range is taken for a SHARED lock, the entire
** shared range is taken for an EXCLUSIVE lock):
**
**      PENDING_BYTE        0x40000000		   	
**      RESERVED_BYTE       0x40000001
**      SHARED_RANGE        0x40000002 -> 0x40000200
**
** This works well on the local file system, but shows a nearly 100x
** slowdown in read performance on AFP because the AFP client disables
** the read cache when byte-range locks are present.  Enabling the read
** cache exposes a cache coherency problem that is present on all OS X
** supported network file systems.  NFS and AFP both observe the
** close-to-open semantics for ensuring cache coherency
** [http://nfs.sourceforge.net/#faq_a8], which does not effectively
** address the requirements for concurrent database access by multiple
** readers and writers
** [http://www.nabble.com/SQLite-on-NFS-cache-coherency-td15655701.html].
**
** To address the performance and cache coherency issues, proxy file locking
** changes the way database access is controlled by limiting access to a
** single host at a time and moving file locks off of the database file
** and onto a proxy file on the local file system.  
**
**
** Using proxy locks
** -----------------
**
** C APIs
**
**  sqlite3_file_control(db, dbname, SQLITE_SET_LOCKPROXYFILE,
**                       <proxy_path> | ":auto:");
**  sqlite3_file_control(db, dbname, SQLITE_GET_LOCKPROXYFILE, &<proxy_path>);
**
**
** SQL pragmas
**
**  PRAGMA [database.]lock_proxy_file=<proxy_path> | :auto:
**  PRAGMA [database.]lock_proxy_file
**
** Specifying ":auto:" means that if there is a conch file with a matching
** host ID in it, the proxy path in the conch file will be used, otherwise
** a proxy path based on the user's temp dir
** (via confstr(_CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR,...)) will be used and the
** actual proxy file name is generated from the name and path of the
** database file.  For example:
**
**       For database path "/Users/me/foo.db" 
**       The lock path will be "<tmpdir>/sqliteplocks/_Users_me_foo.db:auto:")
**
** Once a lock proxy is configured for a database connection, it can not
** be removed, however it may be switched to a different proxy path via
** the above APIs (assuming the conch file is not being held by another
** connection or process). 
**
**
** How proxy locking works
** -----------------------
**
** Proxy file locking relies primarily on two new supporting files: 
**
**   *  conch file to limit access to the database file to a single host
**      at a time
**
**   *  proxy file to act as a proxy for the advisory locks normally
**      taken on the database
**
** The conch file - to use a proxy file, sqlite must first "hold the conch"
** by taking an sqlite-style shared lock on the conch file, reading the
** contents and comparing the host's unique host ID (see below) and lock
** proxy path against the values stored in the conch.  The conch file is
** stored in the same directory as the database file and the file name
** is patterned after the database file name as ".<databasename>-conch".
** If the conch file does not exist, or it's contents do not match the
** host ID and/or proxy path, then the lock is escalated to an exclusive
** lock and the conch file contents is updated with the host ID and proxy
** path and the lock is downgraded to a shared lock again.  If the conch
** is held by another process (with a shared lock), the exclusive lock
** will fail and SQLITE_BUSY is returned.
**
** The proxy file - a single-byte file used for all advisory file locks
** normally taken on the database file.   This allows for safe sharing
** of the database file for multiple readers and writers on the same
** host (the conch ensures that they all use the same local lock file).
**
** There is a third file - the host ID file - used as a persistent record
** of a unique identifier for the host, a 128-byte unique host id file
** in the path defined by the HOSTIDPATH macro (default value is
** /Library/Caches/.com.apple.sqliteConchHostId).
**
** Requesting the lock proxy does not immediately take the conch, it is
** only taken when the first request to lock database file is made.  
** This matches the semantics of the traditional locking behavior, where
** opening a connection to a database file does not take a lock on it.
** The shared lock and an open file descriptor are maintained until 
** the connection to the database is closed. 
**
** The proxy file and the lock file are never deleted so they only need
** to be created the first time they are used.
**
** Configuration options
** ---------------------
**
**  SQLITE_PREFER_PROXY_LOCKING
**
**       Database files accessed on non-local file systems are
**       automatically configured for proxy locking, lock files are
**       named automatically using the same logic as
**       PRAGMA lock_proxy_file=":auto:"
**    
**  SQLITE_PROXY_DEBUG
**
**       Enables the logging of error messages during host id file
**       retrieval and creation
**
**  HOSTIDPATH
**
**       Overrides the default host ID file path location
**
**  LOCKPROXYDIR
**
**       Overrides the default directory used for lock proxy files that
**       are named automatically via the ":auto:" setting
**
**  SQLITE_DEFAULT_PROXYDIR_PERMISSIONS
**
**       Permissions to use when creating a directory for storing the
**       lock proxy files, only used when LOCKPROXYDIR is not set.
**    
**    
** As mentioned above, when compiled with SQLITE_PREFER_PROXY_LOCKING,
** setting the environment variable SQLITE_FORCE_PROXY_LOCKING to 1 will
** force proxy locking to be used for every database file opened, and 0
** will force automatic proxy locking to be disabled for all database
** files (explicity calling the SQLITE_SET_LOCKPROXYFILE pragma or
** sqlite_file_control API is not affected by SQLITE_FORCE_PROXY_LOCKING).

** A Note About Memory Allocation:
**
** This driver uses malloc()/free() directly rather than going through
** the SQLite-wrappers sqlite3_malloc()/sqlite3_free().  Those wrappers
** are designed for use on embedded systems where memory is scarce and
** malloc failures happen frequently.  Win32 does not typically run on
** embedded systems, and when it does the developers normally have bigger
** problems to worry about than running out of memory.  So there is not
** a compelling need to use the wrappers.
**
** But there is a good reason to not use the wrappers.  If we use the
** wrappers then we will get simulated malloc() failures within this
** driver.  And that causes all kinds of problems for our tests.  We
** could enhance SQLite to deal with simulated malloc failures within
** the OS driver, but the code to deal with those failure would not
** be exercised on Linux (which does not need to malloc() in the driver)
** and so we would have difficulty writing coverage tests for that
** code.  Better to leave the code out, we think.
**
** The point of this discussion is as follows:  When creating a new
** OS layer for an embedded system, if you use this file as an example,
** avoid the use of malloc()/free().  Those routines work ok on windows

** This file implements an object that represents a fixed-length
** bitmap.  Bits are numbered starting with 1.
**
** A bitmap is used to record which pages of a database file have been
** journalled during a transaction, or which pages have the "dont-write"
** property.  Usually only a few pages are meet either condition.
** So the bitmap is usually sparse and has low cardinality.
** But sometimes (for example when during a DROP of a large table) most
** or all of the pages in a database can get journalled.  In those cases, 
** the bitmap becomes dense with high cardinality.  The algorithm needs 
** to handle both cases well.
**
** The size of the bitmap is fixed when the object is created.
**
** All bits are clear when the bitmap is created.  Individual bits
** may be set or cleared one at a time.
**
** Test operations are about 100 times more common that set operations.
** Clear operations are exceedingly rare.  There are usually between
** 5 and 500 set operations per Bitvec object, though the number of sets can
** sometimes grow into tens of thousands or larger.  The size of the
** Bitvec object is the number of pages in the database file at the
** start of a transaction, and is thus usually less than a few thousand,
** but can be as large as 2 billion for a really big database.

**                       data held in memory.  This is the initial
**                       state.
**
**   PAGER_SHARED        The page cache is reading the database.
**                       Writing is not permitted.  There can be
**                       multiple readers accessing the same database
**                       file at the same time.
**
**   PAGER_RESERVED      This process has reserved the database for writing
**                       but has not yet made any changes.  Only one process
**                       at a time can reserve the database.  The original
**                       database file has not been modified so other
**                       processes may still be reading the on-disk
**                       database file.
**
**   PAGER_EXCLUSIVE     The page cache is writing the database.
**                       Access is exclusive.  No other processes or
**                       threads can be reading or writing while one
**                       process is writing.
**
**   PAGER_SYNCED        The pager moves to this state from PAGER_EXCLUSIVE
**                       after all dirty pages have been written to the
**                       database file and the file has been synced to
**                       disk. All that remains to do is to remove or
**                       truncate the journal file and the transaction 
**                       will be committed.
**
** The page cache comes up in PAGER_UNLOCK.  The first time a
** sqlite3PagerGet() occurs, the state transitions to PAGER_SHARED.
** After all pages have been released using sqlite_page_unref(),
** the state transitions back to PAGER_UNLOCK.  The first time
** that sqlite3PagerWrite() is called, the state transitions to
** PAGER_RESERVED.  (Note that sqlite3PagerWrite() can only be
** called on an outstanding page which means that the pager must
** be in PAGER_SHARED before it transitions to PAGER_RESERVED.)
** PAGER_RESERVED means that there is an open rollback journal.
** The transition to PAGER_EXCLUSIVE occurs before any changes
** are made to the database file, though writes to the rollback
** journal occurs with just PAGER_RESERVED.  After an sqlite3PagerRollback()
** or sqlite3PagerCommitPhaseTwo(), the state can go back to PAGER_SHARED,
** or it can stay at PAGER_EXCLUSIVE if we are in exclusive access mode.

**   SQLITE_FULL return code is slightly different. It persists only until the
**   next successful rollback is performed on the pager cache. Also,
**   SQLITE_FULL does not affect the sqlite3PagerGet() and sqlite3PagerLookup()
**   APIs, they may still be used successfully.
**
** dbSizeValid, dbSize, dbOrigSize, dbFileSize
**
**   Managing the size of the database file in pages is a little complicated.
**   The variable Pager.dbSize contains the number of pages that the database
**   image currently contains. As the database image grows or shrinks this
**   variable is updated. The variable Pager.dbFileSize contains the number
**   of pages in the database file. This may be different from Pager.dbSize
**   if some pages have been appended to the database image but not yet written
**   out from the cache to the actual file on disk. Or if the image has been
**   truncated by an incremental-vacuum operation. The Pager.dbOrigSize variable
**   contains the number of pages in the database image when the current
**   transaction was opened. The contents of all three of these variables is
**   only guaranteed to be correct if the boolean Pager.dbSizeValid is true.
**
**   TODO: Under what conditions is dbSizeValid set? Cleared?
**
** changeCountDone
**
**   This boolean variable is used to make sure that the change-counter 
**   (the 4-byte header field at byte offset 24 of the database file) is 
**   not updated more often than necessary. 
**
**   It is set to true when the change-counter field is updated, which 
**   can only happen if an exclusive lock is held on the database file.
**   It is cleared (set to false) whenever an exclusive lock is 
**   relinquished on the database file. Each time a transaction is committed,
**   The changeCountDone flag is inspected. If it is true, the work of
**   updating the change-counter is omitted for the current transaction.
**
**   This mechanism means that when running in exclusive mode, a connection 
**   need only update the change-counter once, for the first transaction
**   committed.
**
** dbModified
**
**   The dbModified flag is set whenever a database page is dirtied.
**   It is cleared at the end of each transaction.
**
**   It is used when committing or otherwise ending a transaction. If
**   the dbModified flag is clear then less work has to be done.
**
** journalStarted
**
**   This flag is set whenever the the main journal is synced. 
**
**   The point of this flag is that it must be set after the 
**   first journal header in a journal file has been synced to disk.
**   After this has happened, new pages appended to the database 
**   do not need the PGHDR_NEED_SYNC flag set, as they do not need
**   to wait for a journal sync before they can be written out to
**   the database file (see function pager_write()).
**   
** setMaster
**
**   This variable is used to ensure that the master journal file name
**   (if any) is only written into the journal file once.
**
**   When committing a transaction, the master journal file name (if any)
**   may be written into the journal file while the pager is still in
**   PAGER_RESERVED state (see CommitPhaseOne() for the action). It
**   then attempts to upgrade to an exclusive lock. If this attempt
**   fails, then SQLITE_BUSY may be returned to the user and the user
**   may attempt to commit the transaction again later (calling
**   CommitPhaseOne() again). This flag is used to ensure that the 
**   master journal name is only written to the journal file the first
**   time CommitPhaseOne() is called.
**
** doNotSync
**
**   This variable is set and cleared by sqlite3PagerWrite().
**
** needSync
**
**   TODO: It might be easier to set this variable in writeJournalHdr()
**   and writeMasterJournal() only. Change its meaning to "unsynced data
**   has been written to the journal".

**
** If the journal file is open, then it is "finalized". Once a journal 
** file has been finalized it is not possible to use it to roll back a 
** transaction. Nor will it be considered to be a hot-journal by this
** or any other database connection. Exactly how a journal is finalized
** depends on whether or not the pager is running in exclusive mode and
** the current journal-mode (Pager.journalMode value), as follows:
**
**   journalMode==MEMORY
**     Journal file descriptor is simply closed. This destroys an 
**     in-memory journal.
**
**   journalMode==TRUNCATE
**     Journal file is truncated to zero bytes in size.
**
**   journalMode==PERSIST
**     The first 28 bytes of the journal file are zeroed. This invalidates
**     the first journal header in the file, and hence the entire journal
**     file. An invalid journal file cannot be rolled back.
**
**   journalMode==DELETE
**     The journal file is closed and deleted using sqlite3OsDelete().
**
**     If the pager is running in exclusive mode, this method of finalizing
**     the journal file is never used. Instead, if the journalMode is
**     DELETE and the pager is in exclusive mode, the method described under
**     journalMode==PERSIST is used instead.
**
** After the journal is finalized, if running in non-exclusive mode, the
** pager moves to PAGER_SHARED state (and downgrades the lock on the
** database file accordingly).
**
** If the pager is running in exclusive mode and is in PAGER_SYNCED state,
** it moves to PAGER_EXCLUSIVE. No locks are downgraded when running in
** exclusive mode.
**
** SQLITE_OK is returned if no error occurs. If an error occurs during
** any of the IO operations to finalize the journal file or unlock the
** database then the IO error code is returned to the user. If the 
** operation to finalize the journal file fails, then the code still
** tries to unlock the database file if not in exclusive mode. If the
** unlock operation fails as well, then the first error code related
** to the first error encountered (the journal finalization one) is

** Playback the journal and thus restore the database file to

**
** The journal file format is as follows: 
**
**  (1)  8 byte prefix.  A copy of aJournalMagic[].
**  (2)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the number of valid page records
**       in the journal.  If this value is 0xffffffff, then compute the
**       number of page records from the journal size.
**  (3)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the initial value for the 
**       sanity checksum.
**  (4)  4 byte integer which is the number of pages to truncate the
**       database to during a rollback.
**  (5)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the sector size.  The header
**       is this many bytes in size.
**  (6)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the page case.
**  (7)  4 byte integer which is the number of bytes in the master journal
**       name.  The value may be zero (indicate that there is no master
**       journal.)
**  (8)  N bytes of the master journal name.  The name will be nul-terminated
**       and might be shorter than the value read from (5).  If the first byte
**       of the name is \000 then there is no master journal.  The master
**       journal name is stored in UTF-8.
**  (9)  Zero or more pages instances, each as follows:
**        +  4 byte page number.
**        +  pPager->pageSize bytes of data.
**        +  4 byte checksum
**
** When we speak of the journal header, we mean the first 8 items above.
** Each entry in the journal is an instance of the 9th item.
**
** Call the value from the second bullet "nRec".  nRec is the number of
** valid page entries in the journal.  In most cases, you can compute the
** value of nRec from the size of the journal file.  But if a power
** failure occurred while the journal was being written, it could be the
** case that the size of the journal file had already been increased but
** the extra entries had not yet made it safely to disk.  In such a case,
** the value of nRec computed from the file size would be too large.  For
** that reason, we always use the nRec value in the header.
**
** If the nRec value is 0xffffffff it means that nRec should be computed
** from the file size.  This value is used when the user selects the
** no-sync option for the journal.  A power failure could lead to corruption
** in this case.  But for things like temporary table (which will be
** deleted when the power is restored) we don't care.  
**
** If the file opened as the journal file is not a well-formed
** journal file then all pages up to the first corrupted page are rolled
** back (or no pages if the journal header is corrupted). The journal file
** is then deleted and SQLITE_OK returned, just as if no corruption had
** been encountered.
**
** If an I/O or malloc() error occurs, the journal-file is not deleted
** and an error code is returned.
**
** The isHot parameter indicates that we are trying to rollback a journal
** that might be a hot journal.  Or, it could be that the journal is 
** preserved because of JOURNALMODE_PERSIST or JOURNALMODE_TRUNCATE.
** If the journal really is hot, reset the pager cache prior rolling
** back any content.  If the journal is merely persistent, no reset is

** This may cause hot-journal rollback or a cache purge. See comments

**
** If the requested page is already in the cache, it is returned. 
** Otherwise, a new page object is allocated and populated with data
** read from the database file. In some cases, the pcache module may
** choose not to allocate a new page object and may reuse an existing
** object with no outstanding references.
**
** The extra data appended to a page is always initialized to zeros the 
** first time a page is loaded into memory. If the page requested is 
** already in the cache when this function is called, then the extra
** data is left as it was when the page object was last used.
**
** If the database image is smaller than the requested page or if a 
** non-zero value is passed as the noContent parameter and the 
** requested page is not already stored in the cache, then no 
** actual disk read occurs. In this case the memory image of the 
** page is initialized to all zeros. 
**
** If noContent is true, it means that we do not care about the contents
** of the page. This occurs in two seperate scenarios:
**
**   a) When reading a free-list leaf page from the database, and
**
**   b) When a savepoint is being rolled back and we need to load
**      a new page into the cache to populate with the data read
**      from the savepoint journal.
**
** If noContent is true, then the data returned is zeroed instead of
** being read from the database. Additionally, the bits corresponding
** to pgno in Pager.pInJournal (bitvec of pages already written to the
** journal file) and the PagerSavepoint.pInSavepoint bitvecs of any open
** savepoints are set. This means if the page is made writable at any
** point in the future, using a call to sqlite3PagerWrite(), its contents
** will not be journaled. This saves IO.
**
** The acquisition might fail for several reasons.  In all cases,
** an appropriate error code is returned and *ppPage is set to NULL.
**
** See also sqlite3PagerLookup().  Both this routine and Lookup() attempt
** to find a page in the in-memory cache first.  If the page is not already
** in memory, this routine goes to disk to read it in whereas Lookup()
** just returns 0.  This routine acquires a read-lock the first time it
** has to go to disk, and could also playback an old journal if necessary.
** Since Lookup() never goes to disk, it never has to deal with locks

**
** This file implements a external (disk-based) database using BTrees.
** For a detailed discussion of BTrees, refer to
**
**     Donald E. Knuth, THE ART OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, Volume 3:
**     "Sorting And Searching", pages 473-480. Addison-Wesley
**     Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts.
**
** The basic idea is that each page of the file contains N database
** entries and N+1 pointers to subpages.
**
**   ----------------------------------------------------------------
**   |  Ptr(0) | Key(0) | Ptr(1) | Key(1) | ... | Key(N-1) | Ptr(N) |
**   ----------------------------------------------------------------
**
** All of the keys on the page that Ptr(0) points to have values less
** than Key(0).  All of the keys on page Ptr(1) and its subpages have
** values greater than Key(0) and less than Key(1).  All of the keys
** on Ptr(N) and its subpages have values greater than Key(N-1).  And
** so forth.
**
** Finding a particular key requires reading O(log(M)) pages from the 
** disk where M is the number of entries in the tree.
**
** In this implementation, a single file can hold one or more separate 
** BTrees.  Each BTree is identified by the index of its root page.  The
** key and data for any entry are combined to form the "payload".  A
** fixed amount of payload can be carried directly on the database
** page.  If the payload is larger than the preset amount then surplus
** bytes are stored on overflow pages.  The payload for an entry
** and the preceding pointer are combined to form a "Cell".  Each 
** page has a small header which contains the Ptr(N) pointer and other
** information such as the size of key and data.
**
** FORMAT DETAILS
**
** The file is divided into pages.  The first page is called page 1,
** the second is page 2, and so forth.  A page number of zero indicates
** "no such page".  The page size can be anything between 512 and 65536.
** Each page can be either a btree page, a freelist page or an overflow
** page.
**
** The first page is always a btree page.  The first 100 bytes of the first
** page contain a special header (the "file header") that describes the file.
** The format of the file header is as follows:
**
**   OFFSET   SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      0      16     Header string: "SQLite format 3\000"
**     16       2     Page size in bytes.  
**     18       1     File format write version
**     19       1     File format read version
**     20       1     Bytes of unused space at the end of each page
**     21       1     Max embedded payload fraction
**     22       1     Min embedded payload fraction
**     23       1     Min leaf payload fraction
**     24       4     File change counter
**     28       4     Reserved for future use
**     32       4     First freelist page
**     36       4     Number of freelist pages in the file
**     40      60     15 4-byte meta values passed to higher layers
**
** All of the integer values are big-endian (most significant byte first).
**
** The file change counter is incremented when the database is changed
** This counter allows other processes to know when the file has changed
** and thus when they need to flush their cache.
**
** The max embedded payload fraction is the amount of the total usable
** space in a page that can be consumed by a single cell for standard
** B-tree (non-LEAFDATA) tables.  A value of 255 means 100%.  The default
** is to limit the maximum cell size so that at least 4 cells will fit
** on one page.  Thus the default max embedded payload fraction is 64.
**
** If the payload for a cell is larger than the max payload, then extra
** payload is spilled to overflow pages.  Once an overflow page is allocated,
** as many bytes as possible are moved into the overflow pages without letting
** the cell size drop below the min embedded payload fraction.
**
** The min leaf payload fraction is like the min embedded payload fraction
** except that it applies to leaf nodes in a LEAFDATA tree.  The maximum
** payload fraction for a LEAFDATA tree is always 100% (or 255) and it
** not specified in the header.
**
** Each btree pages is divided into three sections:  The header, the
** cell pointer array, and the cell content area.  Page 1 also has a 100-byte
** file header that occurs before the page header.
**
**      |----------------|
**      | file header    |   100 bytes.  Page 1 only.
**      |----------------|
**      | page header    |   8 bytes for leaves.  12 bytes for interior nodes
**      |----------------|
**      | cell pointer   |   |  2 bytes per cell.  Sorted order.
**      | array          |   |  Grows downward
**      |                |   v
**      |----------------|
**      | unallocated    |
**      | space          |
**      |----------------|   ^  Grows upwards
**      | cell content   |   |  Arbitrary order interspersed with freeblocks.
**      | area           |   |  and free space fragments.
**      |----------------|
**
** The page headers looks like this:
**
**   OFFSET   SIZE     DESCRIPTION
**      0       1      Flags. 1: intkey, 2: zerodata, 4: leafdata, 8: leaf
**      1       2      byte offset to the first freeblock
**      3       2      number of cells on this page
**      5       2      first byte of the cell content area
**      7       1      number of fragmented free bytes
**      8       4      Right child (the Ptr(N) value).  Omitted on leaves.
**
** The flags define the format of this btree page.  The leaf flag means that
** this page has no children.  The zerodata flag means that this page carries
** only keys and no data.  The intkey flag means that the key is a integer
** which is stored in the key size entry of the cell header rather than in
** the payload area.
**
** The cell pointer array begins on the first byte after the page header.
** The cell pointer array contains zero or more 2-byte numbers which are
** offsets from the beginning of the page to the cell content in the cell
** content area.  The cell pointers occur in sorted order.  The system strives
** to keep free space after the last cell pointer so that new cells can
** be easily added without having to defragment the page.
**
** Cell content is stored at the very end of the page and grows toward the
** beginning of the page.
**
** Unused space within the cell content area is collected into a linked list of
** freeblocks.  Each freeblock is at least 4 bytes in size.  The byte offset
** to the first freeblock is given in the header.  Freeblocks occur in
** increasing order.  Because a freeblock must be at least 4 bytes in size,
** any group of 3 or fewer unused bytes in the cell content area cannot
** exist on the freeblock chain.  A group of 3 or fewer free bytes is called
** a fragment.  The total number of bytes in all fragments is recorded.
** in the page header at offset 7.
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      2     Byte offset of the next freeblock
**      2     Bytes in this freeblock
**
** Cells are of variable length.  Cells are stored in the cell content area at
** the end of the page.  Pointers to the cells are in the cell pointer array
** that immediately follows the page header.  Cells is not necessarily
** contiguous or in order, but cell pointers are contiguous and in order.
**
** Cell content makes use of variable length integers.  A variable
** length integer is 1 to 9 bytes where the lower 7 bits of each 
** byte are used.  The integer consists of all bytes that have bit 8 set and
** the first byte with bit 8 clear.  The most significant byte of the integer
** appears first.  A variable-length integer may not be more than 9 bytes long.
** As a special case, all 8 bytes of the 9th byte are used as data.  This
** allows a 64-bit integer to be encoded in 9 bytes.
**
**    0x00                      becomes  0x00000000
**    0x7f                      becomes  0x0000007f
**    0x81 0x00                 becomes  0x00000080
**    0x82 0x00                 becomes  0x00000100
**    0x80 0x7f                 becomes  0x0000007f
**    0x8a 0x91 0xd1 0xac 0x78  becomes  0x12345678
**    0x81 0x81 0x81 0x81 0x01  becomes  0x10204081
**
** Variable length integers are used for rowids and to hold the number of
** bytes of key and data in a btree cell.
**
** The content of a cell looks like this:
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      4     Page number of the left child. Omitted if leaf flag is set.
**     var    Number of bytes of data. Omitted if the zerodata flag is set.
**     var    Number of bytes of key. Or the key itself if intkey flag is set.
**      *     Payload
**      4     First page of the overflow chain.  Omitted if no overflow
**
** Overflow pages form a linked list.  Each page except the last is completely
** filled with data (pagesize - 4 bytes).  The last page can have as little
** as 1 byte of data.
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      4     Page number of next overflow page
**      *     Data
**
** Freelist pages come in two subtypes: trunk pages and leaf pages.  The
** file header points to the first in a linked list of trunk page.  Each trunk
** page points to multiple leaf pages.  The content of a leaf page is
** unspecified.  A trunk page looks like this:
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      4     Page number of next trunk page
**      4     Number of leaf pointers on this page
**      *     zero or more pages numbers of leaves

** Set bit pgno of the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. This is called 
** when a page that previously contained data becomes a free-list leaf 
** page.
**
** The BtShared.pHasContent bitvec exists to work around an obscure
** bug caused by the interaction of two useful IO optimizations surrounding
** free-list leaf pages:
**
**   1) When all data is deleted from a page and the page becomes
**      a free-list leaf page, the page is not written to the database
**      (as free-list leaf pages contain no meaningful data). Sometimes
**      such a page is not even journalled (as it will not be modified,
**      why bother journalling it?).
**
**   2) When a free-list leaf page is reused, its content is not read
**      from the database or written to the journal file (why should it
**      be, if it is not at all meaningful?).
**
** By themselves, these optimizations work fine and provide a handy
** performance boost to bulk delete or insert operations. However, if
** a page is moved to the free-list and then reused within the same
** transaction, a problem comes up. If the page is not journalled when
** it is moved to the free-list and it is also not journalled when it
** is extracted from the free-list and reused, then the original data
** may be lost. In the event of a rollback, it may not be possible
** to restore the database to its original configuration.
**
** The solution is the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. Whenever a page is 
** moved to become a free-list leaf page, the corresponding bit is
** set in the bitvec. Whenever a leaf page is extracted from the free-list,
** optimization 2 above is ommitted if the corresponding bit is already
** set in BtShared.pHasContent. The contents of the bitvec are cleared

** (something which can only happen if pPage is the root page or a 
** child of root) then all available siblings participate in the balancing.
**
** The number of siblings of pPage might be increased or decreased by one or
** two in an effort to keep pages nearly full but not over full. The root page
** is special and is allowed to be nearly empty. If pPage is 
** the root page, then the depth of the tree might be increased
** or decreased by one, as necessary, to keep the root page from being
** overfull or completely empty.
**
** Note that when this routine is called, some of the Cells on pPage
** might not actually be stored in pPage->aData[].  This can happen
** if the page is overfull.  Part of the job of this routine is to
** make sure all Cells for pPage once again fit in pPage->aData[].
**
** In the course of balancing the siblings of pPage, the parent of pPage
** might become overfull or underfull.  If that happens, then this routine
** is called recursively on the parent.
**
** If this routine fails for any reason, it might leave the database
** in a corrupted state.  So if this routine fails, the database should
** be rolled back.

**       structure, in that order.
**
**     * Via the BackupUpdate() and BackupRestart() functions, which are
**       invoked by the pager layer to report various state changes in
**       the page cache associated with the source database. The mutex
**       associated with the source database BtShared structure will always 
**       be held when either of these functions are invoked.
**
**   The other sqlite3_backup_XXX() API functions, backup_remaining() and
**   backup_pagecount() are not thread-safe functions. If they are called
**   while some other thread is calling backup_step() or backup_finish(),
**   the values returned may be invalid. There is no way for a call to
**   BackupUpdate() or BackupRestart() to interfere with backup_remaining()
**   or backup_pagecount().
**
**   Depending on the SQLite configuration, the database handles and/or
**   the Btree objects may have their own mutexes that require locking.
**   Non-sharable Btrees (in-memory databases for example), do not have

**
** Developers using SQLite on an ARM7 should compile and run their
** application using -DSQLITE_DEBUG=1 at least once.  With DEBUG
** enabled, some asserts below will ensure that the byte order of
** floating point values is correct.
**
** (2007-08-30)  Frank van Vugt has studied this problem closely
** and has send his findings to the SQLite developers.  Frank
** writes that some Linux kernels offer floating point hardware
** emulation that uses only 32-bit mantissas instead of a full 
** 48-bits as required by the IEEE standard.  (This is the
** CONFIG_FPE_FASTFPE option.)  On such systems, floating point
** byte swapping becomes very complicated.  To avoid problems,
** the necessary byte swapping is carried out using a 64-bit integer
** rather than a 64-bit float.  Frank assures us that the code here
** works for him.  We, the developers, have no way to independently
** verify this, but Frank seems to know what he is talking about

** The code in this file implements execution method of the

** handles housekeeping details such as creating and deleting

** the VDBE program.
**
** In the external interface, an "sqlite3_stmt*" is an opaque pointer
** to a VDBE.
**
** The SQL parser generates a program which is then executed by
** the VDBE to do the work of the SQL statement.  VDBE programs are 
** similar in form to assembly language.  The program consists of
** a linear sequence of operations.  Each operation has an opcode 
** and 5 operands.  Operands P1, P2, and P3 are integers.  Operand P4 
** is a null-terminated string.  Operand P5 is an unsigned character.
** Few opcodes use all 5 operands.
**
** Computation results are stored on a set of registers numbered beginning
** with 1 and going up to Vdbe.nMem.  Each register can store
** either an integer, a null-terminated string, a floating point
** number, or the SQL "NULL" value.  An implicit conversion from one
** type to the other occurs as necessary.
** 
** Most of the code in this file is taken up by the sqlite3VdbeExec()
** function which does the work of interpreting a VDBE program.
** But other routines are also provided to help in building up
** a program instruction by instruction.

/*****************************************************************************
** What follows is a massive switch statement where each case implements a
** separate instruction in the virtual machine.  If we follow the usual
** indentation conventions, each case should be indented by 6 spaces.  But
** that is a lot of wasted space on the left margin.  So the code within
** the switch statement will break with convention and be flush-left. Another
** big comment (similar to this one) will mark the point in the code where
** we transition back to normal indentation.
**
** The formatting of each case is important.  The makefile for SQLite
** generates two C files "opcodes.h" and "opcodes.c" by scanning this
** file looking for lines that begin with "case OP_".  The opcodes.h files
** will be filled with #defines that give unique integer values to each
** opcode and the opcodes.c file is filled with an array of strings where
** each string is the symbolic name for the corresponding opcode.  If the
** case statement is followed by a comment of the form "/# same as ... #/"
** that comment is used to determine the particular value of the opcode.
**
** Other keywords in the comment that follows each case are used to
** construct the OPFLG_INITIALIZER value that initializes opcodeProperty[].
** Keywords include: in1, in2, in3, out2_prerelease, out2, out3.  See
** the mkopcodeh.awk script for additional information.
**
** Documentation about VDBE opcodes is generated by scanning this file
** for lines of that contain "Opcode:".  That line and all subsequent
** comment lines are used in the generation of the opcode.html documentation
** file.
**
** SUMMARY:
**
**     Formatting is important to scripts that scan this file.
**     Do not deviate from the formatting style currently in use.

/*
** This routine walks an expression tree and resolves references to
** table columns and result-set columns.  At the same time, do error
** checking on function usage and set a flag if any aggregate functions
** are seen.
**
** To resolve table columns references we look for nodes (or subtrees) of the 
** form X.Y.Z or Y.Z or just Z where
**
**      X:   The name of a database.  Ex:  "main" or "temp" or
**           the symbolic name assigned to an ATTACH-ed database.
**
**      Y:   The name of a table in a FROM clause.  Or in a trigger
**           one of the special names "old" or "new".
**
**      Z:   The name of a column in table Y.
**
** The node at the root of the subtree is modified as follows:
**
**    Expr.op        Changed to TK_COLUMN
**    Expr.pTab      Points to the Table object for X.Y
**    Expr.iColumn   The column index in X.Y.  -1 for the rowid.
**    Expr.iTable    The VDBE cursor number for X.Y
**
**
** To resolve result-set references, look for expression nodes of the
** form Z (with no X and Y prefix) where the Z matches the right-hand
** size of an AS clause in the result-set of a SELECT.  The Z expression
** is replaced by a copy of the left-hand side of the result-set expression.
** Table-name and function resolution occurs on the substituted expression
** tree.  For example, in:
**
**      SELECT a+b AS x, c+d AS y FROM t1 ORDER BY x;
**
** The "x" term of the order by is replaced by "a+b" to render:
**
**      SELECT a+b AS x, c+d AS y FROM t1 ORDER BY a+b;
**
** Function calls are checked to make sure that the function is 
** defined and that the correct number of arguments are specified.
** If the function is an aggregate function, then the pNC->hasAgg is
** set and the opcode is changed from TK_FUNCTION to TK_AGG_FUNCTION.
** If an expression contains aggregate functions then the EP_Agg
** property on the expression is set.
**
** An error message is left in pParse if anything is amiss.  The number
** if errors is returned.

** This function is used by the implementation of the IN (...) operator.
** It's job is to find or create a b-tree structure that may be used
** either to test for membership of the (...) set or to iterate through
** its members, skipping duplicates.
**
** The cursor opened on the structure (database table, database index 
** or ephermal table) is stored in pX->iTable before this function returns.
** The returned value indicates the structure type, as follows:
**
**   IN_INDEX_ROWID - The cursor was opened on a database table.
**   IN_INDEX_INDEX - The cursor was opened on a database index.
**   IN_INDEX_EPH -   The cursor was opened on a specially created and
**                    populated epheremal table.
**
** An existing structure may only be used if the SELECT is of the simple
** form:
**
**     SELECT <column> FROM <table>
**
** If prNotFound parameter is 0, then the structure will be used to iterate
** through the set members, skipping any duplicates. In this case an
** epheremal table must be used unless the selected <column> is guaranteed
** to be unique - either because it is an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY or it
** is unique by virtue of a constraint or implicit index.
**
** If the prNotFound parameter is not 0, then the structure will be used 
** for fast set membership tests. In this case an epheremal table must 
** be used unless <column> is an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY or an index can 
** be found with <column> as its left-most column.
**
** When the structure is being used for set membership tests, the user
** needs to know whether or not the structure contains an SQL NULL 
** value in order to correctly evaluate expressions like "X IN (Y, Z)".
** If there is a chance that the structure may contain a NULL value at
** runtime, then a register is allocated and the register number written
** to *prNotFound. If there is no chance that the structure contains a
** NULL value, then *prNotFound is left unchanged.
**
** If a register is allocated and its location stored in *prNotFound, then
** its initial value is NULL. If the structure does not remain constant
** for the duration of the query (i.e. the set is a correlated sub-select), 
** the value of the allocated register is reset to NULL each time the 
** structure is repopulated. This allows the caller to use vdbe code 
** equivalent to the following:
**
**   if( register==NULL ){
**     has_null = <test if data structure contains null>
**     register = 1
**   }
**
** in order to avoid running the <test if data structure contains null>
** test more often than is necessary.
